I have a great deal to say to my friends in that town on the subject. I was forced from amongst those whom I shall ever respect, because I dared to advocate the rights of the people.  I know your paper was started to maintain the same principles, and I therefore, venture to beg a little space in it till I show my enemies that I have done those things which every man in the kingdom ought to do, and that when they persecuted me, they were opposing truth and justice. Radicalism shall have its day in spite of the factions.  Your answer will greatly oblige.",0

The Repealers having taken this room for Mr. M. in consequence of his defeat on the preceding Thursday night. There might be 1,200 in the room when the lecturer entered it. As soon as he came forward, Mr. Bairstow asked him if he would allow discussion at the close of the lecture, to which, after a great deal of circumlocution and evasion, he gave a decided negative; whereupon Mr. Bairstow stood forth, and stated to the working men that he had pressed Mr. Murray to allow debate at his lecture’s finish, that Mr. M. had flatly refused, and that he (Mr. B.) would advise the working men to retire from the Hall immediately, to the Market-place, where he would deliver a lecture on the Repeal of the Corn Laws, and expose the humbugging of the League. No sooner said than done. Instantly the working men rose in one dense body, and, amid most terrific yelling, groaning, and hooting, left thirty repealers all alone in their glory, whilst Mr. Murray stood the most ghastly astonishment. He never had at any time in the Hall, as many as 150 after the Shakspearian brigade left. We had full 3000 in the Market-place, and Mr. Bairstow gave it the Repealers for full two hours, and then again advertised an address for the following night in the Market-place, on the same subject, challenging Mr. Murray and the whole of the smaller guns of Leicester. Even after we had got 3,000 at our meeting in the Market-place those of our lads who went back to the",1

It is pretty generally known that since the recent turn out of hands in this county, the weavers, (i. e. those who weave at power-looms) have, up to this time, continued idle; but few having chosen to return to their employment at the present rate of wages.  During the time of this cessation from labour, which is now about six weeks, that class of operatives have been living chiefly on the bounty of others who appear to sympathise with their case. Meetings have accordingly been held at different times and places, to distribute the alms thus obtained, and so far as we can learn, this has been done with a fairness and an impartiality highly creditable to those to whom this business has been entrusted. A meeting of this kind, and for the purpose above-named, took place yesterday at the Chartist meeting room, in Brown-street, Ancoats, a very large portion of which consisted of females, who are generally engaged at power-looms, in preference to men. As the room is but small, the number of persons who had to receive a portion of these subscriptions exceeded the accommodation it afforded, and were consequently obliged to remain outside. The people, however, were perfectly quiet, and did not exhibit the slightest symptom of disorderly conduct, nor was the least danger apprehended from their assembling in the manner already stated, inasmuch as it was known that they had met to receive their share of the contributions, which amounted to threepence each—the allowance of each for a week! At the outset, a question",1

McDouall, on “the Evils of Class Legislation,” which was attended by above one thousand people—more than was ever expected, considering that there was no association in the town, and it being a bigoted Tory place. It was the first time that ever a meeting was got up by the working men; and they have shewn the enemies of freedom that they can act for themselves. The meeting commenced at half-past six o'clock. Mr. McFarlin, of Northampton, was called to the chair. A resolution was proposed by Thomas Webb, cordwainer, seconded by Dan. Marks, labourer, and carried amidst the cheers of all present, adopting the National Petition, pledging the meeting to support the Executive Council, and to join the National Charter Association. The chairman then called upon Doctor McDouall to address the meeting, which he did in his usual expressive and animating style, for nearly two hours; shewing the evils of class legislation, and the benefit to be derived by making the Charter become the law of the land. The Doctor was cheered repeatedly throughout the lecture; after which, twenty-six persons enrolled their names as members of the National Charter Association. The Chartists of Daventry will meet every Wednesday evening, at eight o'clock, at the house of Thomas Webb, Union-place, when the sub-secretary of the National Charter Association will be in attendance to enrol the name of any person who may wish to become a member.

The main question evidently was Mr. Hume's opinions on the Income Tax; but he soon left that topic, and went at great length into the Reform question. Two sentences we note as containing admissions which may be actually remembered. First that the whole people ought to ""concur"" in the appointment of the House of Commons, and secondly, that he, Joseph Hume, did not ""wish to give the suffrage to any man as a boon or a favour, but he wished to give it to every man as a right."" What is this but universal suffrage?  It is understood that knighthood has been offered to Mr. Faxton, to Mr. Cubitt, the engineer, and to Mr. Fox, the contractor, as some recognition of their eminent services in relation to the Crystal Palace.  Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton will, it is said, be opposed by Mr. Pullen, of Young'sbury, at the next general election. Hereofsire will thenceforward have an opportunity of deciding between Protection and Retrogression, and Free Trade and Reform.  Lord Brougham intends, it is said, during the ensuing session of Parliament, to submit to the Government (with a view of improving the system now in force for admitting gentlemen) to the bar a proposition for combining the Middle and Inner Temples, Gray's Inn, and Lincoln's Inn, into one legal University, to be governed by a Senate and Chancellor, similar to other universities. In this university Professorships are to be established in the different branches of law and equity, who are to lecture as the Professors do at Oxford or Cambridge. It is also proposed to abolish the immense fees which are at present charged for ""entering.""  Mr. Kindersley, Master in",1

The fact is now beyond denial—either that Universal Suffrage must be the law of the land, the delegates must betray their trust, or that brute force must be called to the aid of moral weakness and turpitude. In either case the power is in the people. Should the Delegates, or any one of them—which we see no reason to suspect—play their constituents false, the tenure is only durable _bona fide_ placite, or during pleasure, and be or they can be got rid of. Upon the other hand, should any violence be resorted to, as a defensive body the Delegates must fight at the head of the people, upon whose courage they are ready to risk life and limb. The resistance of DUNCOMBE'S very moderate amendment to the Address upon the Lion Queen's Speech, shows that the House of Commons merely intended the Reform Bill as a clap-trap measure; and now, the minority of 88, who voted upon that amendment, must either join in the people's demand, or they also will be chargeable with being parties to another description of deception, not less culpable. The country has now but one duty to perform, namely, to pour in petitions, backed by as much voluntary tax as they can conveniently spare, for the national purpose; and to watch the every word of their Delegates. When the Petition shall be disposed of, then, according to circumstances, we must be prepared to act; for as to our more petition, we most respectfully, for ourselves, beg leave to act our lives again; neither shall we accept the office of watchmen to a second demand.

The letters of John Mitchel and Devin Reilly having been read from the United Irishman, which were received with loud cheering, the chairman proceeded to address the meeting upon the importance of a union between all classes of working men. It was their duty to be watchful and determined, for the government intended to attack the small remnant of liberty left in England, if possible, through the person of that uncompromising patriot, John Mitchel, and it believed them not to relax in their efforts for the advancement of the principles of liberty in the motherland and sister country. Mr. Jones (an Englishman) said, he had been engaged in the late Repeal agitation, and had, up to the last few weeks, followed out the moral free policy of the late Liberator. But, in the words of that great man, he believed that 'England's difficulty was Ireland's 'opportunity.' He (Mr Jones) believed that Ireland's opportunity had now arrived, and he went hearand hand with the Confederation. The sacred cause of English liberty was being fought at the present moment in the jury box in Dublin.

On the motion of Mr. Cowan, seconded by Mr. Mills, it was resolved that a general meeting of the Chartists of London should be held, into whose hands the delegates should resign their trust previous to commencing the New Organization. A unanimous feeling in favour of the New Plan of Organization was unequivocally manifested.  BIRMINGHAM.—On Sunday morning, Mr. Mason held his usual open air meeting, at Duddeston Row. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Mason lectured in the Hall of Science, to a numerous audience.

The lecturer shewed, in his usual clear manner, that all property had its origin in labour, and that all property was protected but labour, and also that all property was represented but labour. He richly commented on things as they are, and as they should be; and concluded by strongly recommending the working men to a closer union, for the establishing of their claim to Universal Suffrage, and the other points of the glorious Charter.

There is something in the movements of public men to strengthen the belief that the present Parliament will not keep together. Lord John Russell, seeing that he has not long to sit for London, has been settling himself at Stroud—an intelligent place; and his Exeter Hall demonstration will probably secure him in the favourite constituency of Foulmart Thompson and Jellingham Simmons. Mr Gladstone may, perhaps, count upon retaining his Oxford seat, but in the meanwhile he is saying good things—taking up a democratic position on colonial grounds; a safe range for a Conservative Minister in England. The City of London is promising its votes to Lord Palmerston, who is, however, not to be inconvenienced by any uncertainties at Tiverton: he is all but pronounced a double election, and will have to divide his affection between the Exe and the Thames.

Looking at the operation of Joint-stock Banks, and other moneyed interests, he contended that a repeal of the Corn Laws would be productive of great evil to all classes of the community.

Every satisfaction was given by those men to their fellow-workmen. There appears every prospect of success, though it is entailing a great deal of distress upon poor workmen, who are only striving to protect their wages from the inroads of a tyrant. There has been a uniformity of wages ever since two of our noble minded patriots were transported in 1821. There was also a great meeting of the weavers of Dodworth, on Monday afternoon, when eloquent appeals were made by Messrs. Shaw and Alexander, and all classes protested that they would support the weavers.  BRISTOL.—Ticket meetings are the order of the day here, and the Whigs are trying all their arts to gull the trades into the support of Mr. Berkeley. A grand public meeting, on “Free Trade” principles was called for Monday night, in Ryan’s Amphitheatre; but, like all other meetings of late, it was not only “ticketed,” but packed with the dupes of the “Plague,” in order that so inconvenient a subject as discussion might not find room to enter. It was also well guarded by police. Mr. Cobden, of Manchester, of bludgeon notoriety, with his company of free traders, was in attendance; and, in one of his flowery, unmeaning speeches, threw dust in the eyes of his dupes, and blinded them to their own interest. Free trade was declared to be the panacea for all the grievances under which we labour. Mr. Berkeley was expected to show, but, though loudly called for, he did not come, and a promise was held out that he would be present on a",1

MY DEAR FRIENDS,—As I dare say you will see reports of some of the magnificent meetings that I have attended within the last ten days, I shall merely offer a few comments upon matters which may possibly be otherwise omitted.  NEWCASTLE.  On Thursday last I attended a meeting in Newcastle, which was a bumper: our valued and indomitable friend Mr. Roberts in the chair; and as the subject announced was a Repeal of the Union, my own gallant countrymen attended in great numbers. Some parties who have been RUINED BY PUSHING THE STAR, did all that lay in their power to make the meeting a failure; while the Free Traders put their champion, Mr. Wm. Thomason forward to oppose me, but it was all to no purpose. I was assured that Chartism was completely dead in Newcastle, but never, not even in 1839, did I ever witness so good or determined a Chartist spirit as now exists in this locality. Every attempt has been made to destroy our movement; but a few good honest working men have braved all difficulties, and Chartism has become the religious creed of the working classes. At the close of the meeting, Thomason brought in his charges against me. The one, that my friends had charged him with dishonesty while acting as servant to some society; the other, that he did not get fair play at a meeting held at Newcastle, on the 5th of June last, at which I was not present. Now such were the mighty charges that he had against me. He got every fair play from the meeting, but was actually obliged to finish where he began. A unanimous vote of thanks was given to me; and my countrymen appeared to be perfectly satisfied with my exposure of the cry of Federalism meaning nothing more or less that the restoration of the Whigs; to which they are opposed",1

If they looked back to history, they would find that those men who were most virtuous, indomitable, unconquerable, and prominent in the agitation of the people, had ever had the shafts of the law arrayed against them to crush them, and were watched by the Government as objects of their persecution, torture, and destruction. Many of those had been put within the gloomy walls of a dungeon, and there, in many instances, left to perish; others had been consigned to the gibbet—to transportation, and the scaffold—(hear, hear). He stood there not to flatter them, but to tell them the truth.

The resolution was not put to the vote. I was at another meeting on the 10th. Pilling was there. He said he had been at Oldham, where he had met with some opposition.

Mr. Good concluded his address by impressing on the meeting the right of every man to the Suffrage, as embodied in the Charter, and sat down amidst loud applause. Mr. Allen followed, and lamented the treachery to the works, and said he was determined never to petition again unless it were for Universal Suffrage, till they were fully represented in their ""own House.""

Whenever a country is taken by surprise, the boldness of the measure that creates it for a short time has a paralysing effect, but reaction is sure to follow; and hence we find that the majority calculated upon excitement is dwindling down as thought progresses, while the rejection of the measure by the Lords is no longer spoken of as a mad freak of that mad assembly, but as an almost natural result. Before we go to press, it is not at all unlikely that the Earl of Lincoln, the son of his Grace of Newcastle— who, it appears, has NOT A RIGHT to do what he likes with his own child—may be added to the list of rejected free traders. The Duke of Newcastle (no doubt emboldened by the defence offered by Sir Robert Peel, on the motion of Mr. Collett, for those peers who interfere at elections) has addressed a very significant letter to the electors of South Nottinghamshire, calling upon them to reject his son, and to send him back to the place from whence he came.

Heretofore they had appealed only to the members of their own society; but the present meeting appealed to the trades of London to assist them in the struggle existing between them and their employers. The evils they complained of had been of long duration, and large bodies of their trade had on several occasions declared that piecework and systematic overtime were injurious. The employers had misconstrued their views and statements relative to these grievances. All that they had said on the subject was that the Amalgamated Society thought the practice to be injurious; but they did not interfere with the right of men, not connected with them, to make such contracts as they thought proper. The members of their trade thought they had struck a fatal blow at overtime, when they taxed the employers twenty-five per cent more for the hours so occupied; but notwithstanding this, there were shops in that metropolis where the engine that kept the tools going never ceased from one month's end to another. The speaker then showed that the Society had originated in purely benevolent purposes, and deserved the support of all right-thinking men.

The entire front of almost every house was hid with green bushes and wreathes of flowers, and the half dozen residences that formed exception to the general rule only served to heighten the effect, in shewing by their bare walls (as destitute of the enlivening hue of the national colour as the hearts of their occupiers were of national feeling), how few the enemies of repeal really were. At short intervals, through all the streets—not only those through which O'Connell should pass, but also the streets which were wholly out of his way—were erected beautiful triumphal arches, several of which were decorated with flags of red, green, and white; and all bearing appropriate inscriptions, such as ""Cead mile failte,"" ""Ireland for the Irish,"" and the Irish for Ireland,"" ""Ireland must be a nation,"" ""We seek equality, not ascendancy through the Repeal,"" ""The man who commits a crime gives strength to the enemy,"" ""We must have Repeal,"" ""A nation of eight millions is too powerful to be dragged at the tail of any other country,"" ""Repeal, and no Surrender,"" ""Repeal, Repeal,"" &c. &c.

No topic of sectarian agitation has occasioned more rancour and misrepresentation than that of Sunday labour in the Post-office. With one party the object has, no doubt, been to damage the present Government, by representing it as ""infidel"" in its tendencies, and as always anxious to please the commercial and manufacturing classes; with another party the object is simply to use this official annoyance as a means of promoting the general agitation for abolishing Sunday labour of every description—the end of course sanctifying the means. Let the *Morning Herald* and *Standard* say whether we misrepresent the political party that has been nicknamed ""the Saints""; let the *Patriot* and other journals of its kind correct us if we err as to the Sabbatarian agitators. Or rather, if they care for the truth of the matter, let them read Mr. Rowland Hill's Report to the Postmaster-General, showing the results of the measures recently adopted for the reduction of Sunday labour in the Post-office. The whole of the evidence in that report goes to prove the utter falsehood of the charge brought against the Post-office authorities that they have lately been devising schemes to increase the amount of labour on Sunday. The fact, most clearly established, is, that during the last two years every possible effort has been made to lessen labour on that day, and that the measures adopted for this purpose have been signally successful. By closing the provincial offices throughout England and Wales from ten to five on Sunday, by restricting Sunday deliveries in provincial towns to one, and by providing for the transmission of the ""forward"" letters through London on Sunday, so as to be delivered on Monday, no less than 6000 Post-office clerks have been relieved from Sunday labour on the average",0

The ""strike"" lasted for two-and-thirty weeks, yet such was the generous support they received in their righteous struggle that, as appears by an account of the receipts and disbursements just published, a copy of which has been sent to us, each person received, on an average, 10s. a week throughout the whole period of the ""turn out,"" at the termination of which they had still something in hand.  This is gratifying, inasmuch as it proves the existence of a real spirit of fraternity amongst the workers, and also that, with support, the working men may very successfully defend their labour against the encroachments of capital, notwithstanding the many and great disadvantages they labour under in such a strife.  It is indisputable that ""strikes"" very seldom tend to the benefit of the workers. The capitalist may suffer a money loss much greater than any one of them, or perhaps of all of them together: but if he is only determined enough to make this sacrifice, he is certain to conquer; as hunger, an enemy he has not to encounter, will fight his battle, and in time will bring the men to terms. But, notwithstanding all this, in such cases as that of the Chiswell-street type-founders, the men can only choose the lesser of two evils; they must submit to the grossest injustice, or they must ""strike.""

If you had given yourself the trouble to inquire, you would have found that Mr. Owen, the founder of Socialism, advises his followers to have no connection with any political body, and in much the same dogmatic style as you have issued your mandates to the Repealers, but not indeed from the same motives. He believes that no political change can better the condition of mankind, as long as society is based on the present political competitive system. I cannot agree with Mr. Owen in the course he is pursuing, for I hold that until the people have the power of destroying the laws of primogeniture and entail, they will get nothing either on the land or off it.

In the first instance, the Opposition exerted itself to keep the merits of Lord CANNING'S Proclamation out of sight, evidently because many of the party could not agree in the propriety of the confiscation. There was an air but unanimous feeling that, be the Proclamation right or wrong, Lord Exeter had no right to condemn it before explanation, his fault being aggravated by the publication of his despatch. It became, however, impossible to exclude that part of the subject from the debate, and while the merits of Lord CANNING'S Indian policy came to be the professed subject of discussion, the conflicting aspirations of party were also freely introduced into the open debate; and before the week closed, the speaking in anticipation of the voting derived no small part of its success from a simple array of members on the one or the other side. On the first night, the late leader of the House of Commons was seen with Lord John RUSSELL by his side, and many leading Liberals attached to the late Government duly taking their places: Mr. CARDWELL himself was a very important accession; Lord GODERICH stood for the moderate independent Liberals; and the muster-roll of the Liberals appeared to be complete, saving a few scattered defections supposed to be represented by certain gentlemen who have held meetings in one of the committee-rooms.

Indeed, in those days when the people's representatives were obliged to return to their constituents at the close of each session, to receive their smiles as a reward for virtue, or their frowns as a punishment for vice, the best title that the candidate could plead was his observance of the popular will, and a ready compliance with its commands. The time was so short between the commission of wrong and the certain punishment of the wrong-doer, that few were found hardy enough to resist the remonstrances of those who were so speedily to constitute his judges. Thus we find, that in the times when Parliaments were annual, the House of Commons in most instances anticipated the popular will, and was the first to sound the alarm when the royal prerogative or the power of the Lords threatened any abridgment of popular rights. The successive invasions upon the people which were commenced by Henry VIII., and which have been going on increasing in enormity from the period when the duration of Parliaments was extended from three to seven years, in the reign of George I., have one and all been direct consequences of the abrogation of the right of annual elections. When Henry's subservient slaves abrogated Sessional Parliaments, and extended the tenure which their constituents had conferred upon them for only one year, to a period of three years, the Constitution of England was virtually and actually annulled, and the people would have been justified in falling back upon Magna Charta, in arm-ing themselves, dethroning the tyrant, ejecting the Commons, and resuming again that trust, which in the hands of their delegates had been violated.

The deputies of the Sonderbund quitted Berne on the 9th, having first published a protest and manifesto against the acts of the Diet. According to the latest accounts, the troops of the Confederation were marching on the insurgent cantons.  ### ITALY  Terror reigns throughout the dominions of the King of Naples. The most infernal cruelties are inflicted upon the insurgents who fall into the hands of the royalist party.  ## To Readers & Correspondents.  ### MISCELLANEOUS.

You will not again see REPEAL PLEDGINGS converted into Whig tools by the simple process of patronage. You recollect the very equireal compliment paid to Mr O’Connell by Charles Buller, when he assured the HOUSE that ‘Ireland was in a perpetual state of incipient revolution, which was only checked by the policy of her leader, and which no other but his departure could restrain.’ The danger from Ireland now is, the fervour with which contending PATRIOTS will bid for popular support; and hated to England, and still more to Whiggerty, will be the PATRIOTS’ engine of power.

Throughout life, Mr. Shore looked with solicitude to the popular parts of our well-balanced constitution, which he thought in more danger of injury than the monarchical or aristocratical portions of it. He looked with an apprehension, in which many great and wise men agreed with him, to an increase of the influence of the Crown, too great for the safety of the people; and in his character of a citizen of this great country, he thought it his duty to support all measures which tended to maintain, or even to give an increase, correspondent to the increased influence of the Crown, to the rights and privileges of the commonalty. In his own county (Derby) he was the supporter of the house of Cavendish, because that house was a supporter of the principles which he thought essential to the maintenance of the public weal. And in the county of his birth, though not of his residence, and where he possessed great interests, he was the supporter of that public interest of which Sir George Savile might, in his day, be accounted the illustrious representative. When the principles of those who leaned to the monarchical, and of those who leaned to the popular part of the constitution, became posited on the great question of Parliamentary Reform, Mr. Shore was among the foremost of those eminent persons in the county of York who formed the Yorkshire Association of former times; and when the great Yorkshire petition for reform was agreed upon, he was one of the deputies to whom the care of it was committed.

Our readers will perceive that this bill meets with great opposition in the House of Lords, who are also a house of landlords, many of them being also Irish landlords. Had the bill been better, and more practicable than it is, this opposition would have been the same. The truth of the matter is, the Irish landlords have, for centuries, considered their tenants as mere serfs; and any step to rescue them from this state of vassalage they very naturally consider, and call, an ""invasion of the rights of property""; they being the only authorities as to what these rights really are. We, for our parts, consider the introduction of this bill into Parliament an important point; not because we deem the bill a good one practically, but because it embodies in a ministerial bill, for the first time, a great principle. In itself, as a practical measure, the bill will fail. It cannot be worked, if passed.  A law to render rent not recoverable, except under a lease of a long date, would have been infinitely better, because it would secure the tenant the benefit of his outlay, and need no machinery. But as embodying a great principle, this bill, we affirm, is a highly important one. When brought in, the mover stated, in plain terms, that the ""monster evil"" of Ireland was ""even population."" This he distinctly stated at setting out. He is right—it is so: and this bill he described as being one means to cure that evil of ""over population,"" inasmuch as it would go to ""better the condition and means of living"" of every holder of land in Ireland, from the large farmer to the poor holder of an acre or two.

If men can be safely left to the promptings of their own will to do that which is strictly just, the statutes may be made a bonfire of.

From Long Compton I proceeded towards the small town of Morton, and on the road I passed by the house of a man of the name of Skillet. About twenty years ago this person was allowed to enclose about half an acre of waste ground by the road side; since that period he has been allowed at various times to enclose about three acres more. For the original half an acre he paid no rent, but pays a moderate rent for the remainder. By the profit from this ground he has been enabled to build himself a house, barn, &c. He has three cows, three sheep, pigs, poultry, &c., and has brought up seven children, giving them a good education. He lives in a village called Chaslington, at a lone house, far remote from any market.

In the same parish about forty acres have since been let out in allotments, varying from one to four acres.

A short time after this eight shillings free trade proposal, the duty on corn was down at 1s. a quarter. (Loud cheers.) Now they have given us what they call free trade in sugar. This free trade consists in 1yd. a pound duty on sugar. But this is not all, say these Whigs. No, it is not. The duty on slave grown sugar and free labour sugar, is to be equalised. Now this free trade, not in sugar, but in slaves. At one, and the same time, they keep a squadron to prevent the slave trade; while, by their legislation, they do all they can to increase it.

In the moment of his severest trial, when delivering the speech which closed his official career, after speaking of the ties of party which he had severed for ever, of the political friendships he had converted into bitter enmities, of the floodgates of calumny he had let loose upon himself—after recounting, mournfully but without repining, the sacrifices he had made, he turned for sympathy and justice to the mass of the people and closed his last speech as Minister with the following words: —  It may be that I shall leave a name sometimes remembered with expressions of goodwill in the abode of those whose lot it is to labour and to earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow, when they shall recruit their exhausted strength with abundant and untaxed food, the sweeter because it is no longer layened by a sense of injustice.

If ""Ion"" ever reads history, he ought to know that the English have, on several occasions, attempted to interfere with Scottish affairs, but that almost all their attempts failed. From the days of Edward I. to those of Land, the Scotch never felt any gratitude for the alliance offered them by Edward, or for the Bishops and Liturgies proffered by Land. In religious matters particularly the Scots have been extremely jealous of interference by any other party whatsoever.  The people of Glasgow had a similar struggle with a railway company some years ago, and effectively succeeded in stopping railways on Sunday, the consequence is, that hundreds of railway employees can spend their Sabbaths in the bosom of their families, whilst, according to ""Ion's"" wise plan they would be toiling either as firemen, as cleaners, or whatever their work might be.

The Times and Chronicle try to make their readers believe that not 20,000 were present. Truth compels me to notice this, for the errors of a party afford no justification of a total misrepresentation of their numbers or their proceedings. The Common is about 500 yards long and 200 broad; giving an acre in square yards of about 100,000. Now, at one o'clock, the whole space was dotted over—the centre very dense, and the out-side rather thin and straggling. Assuming only one person to the square yard, instead of nine, the usual calculation in a crowded meeting, we have 10,000 persons. Those at least were on the ground yesterday. Independent of the crowds in the adjoining thoroughfares, I went expressly all round the Common to be satisfied with my estimate; which, had the meeting been for any more aristocratic party purpose, would, no doubt, have figured in the 'Thunderer' at 200,000 souls.'",0

This might suffice; for all his reasoning depends on this sequence, and it depends on nothing. But allow me to ask, can he, by any division of power, secure an infallible government?

In the ""olden times,"" Royalty reserved its smiles and its honours for the tournament and the battle-field. Up to a very recent period, even in our own country, they were bestowed almost exclusively upon men trained to the arts of war, and the characteristic court-spectacle of a landed aristocracy was a review in Hyde Park, or a grand field-day at Woolwich.  ""Nous avons changé tout cela,""—as our French neighbours say.—We have changed all that. A new public opinion has been created and the Court—with true state-craft, if not an enlightened prescience—is adapting itself to the altered position of affairs. In the person of her husband the QUEEN takes every opportunity of propitiating the trading classes, and of identifying her dynasty with their prosperity. A few days ago a numerous and highly influential meeting of citizens was held at the Mansion House, for the purpose of co-operating with PRINCE ALBERT in his proposed Exhi- bition of the Industry of all Nations. This week the PRINCE, accompanied by the heir to the throne, and by his eldest daughter, has returned the compliment by attending the formal opening of the New Coal Exchange. The illness of the QUEEN prevented her from being present, and so the “loyal citizens” had to comfort themselves as they best could, with the debut of the young PRINCE and PRINCESS in public, as a substitute.

Sir R. PEEL observed that the question of the further continuance of the income tax, could not be separated from a consideration of the circumstances which had led to its imposition in 1842, and its renewal in 1845; which circumstances he proceeded to recapitulate, in vindication of the government which had proposed, and the House of Commons which, by overwhelming majorities, had sanctioned its imposition and renewal. It had been recommended to the house by commercial as well as financial considerations. Had direct taxation not been resorted to in 1842, the accumulated deficiency of years in 1848 would have been about ten millions sterling. It was chiefly to avoid this deficit that the tax was imposed in 1842, and mainly with a view to lay the foundation of a better system of general taxation, that it was renewed in 1845: When it was renewed, his wish was, that its renewal should be for a period of five years, at the end of which he ventured to express a hope that it could be dispensed with, altogether, from the buoyancy of the ordinary sources of the revenue. The right hon. gentleman then adverted to the great change in our commercial policy, which had been based upon the continuance of the tax, and declared that as long as he lived he would never repent the share which he had taken in the introduction of these changes. It had been predicted, when the income tax was imposed, that other sources of income would give way, and that the assessed taxes, for instance, would fall off, a prediction which had been falsified, the receipts from the assessed taxes being, in 1847, about £100,000 greater than in 1842, before direct taxation had been reported to.

The outrage was committed as long ago as the 19th of last June; but the complainant, Mr. George Harris Child, a wine merchant in Mark-lane, was so severely injured that he had been confined to his bed ever since. From the statement he now made, it appeared that he hailed the omnibus in King William-street, City, on the day mentioned, but the conductor refused to admit him, though there was room. Mr. Child remonstrated with him, touching his legs with an umbrella, to call his attention, when the conductor abused him. On threatening to report his conduct, Olive dealt Mr. Child a heavy blow over the eye, which felled him, and, his head striking against the kerb stone, he became unconscious. He was taken home; but erysipelas set in, his head swelled to double its size, and his life had been in great danger.

""The above observations apply generally to any case in which money for travelling expenses is granted to any pauper, even although the effect of it, in some peculiar cases, might not be to make a pauper chargeable to any other parish; but in the instance now under consideration the Poor Law Commissioners cannot refrain from pointing out that the directors and guardians of Marylebone acted unfairly in supplying Thomas Phillips and his family with money to proceed to the parish of Bicester King's-end, when the Bicester Board of Guardians had so expressly stated that the parish was not satisfied about his settlement, and when the obvious tendency of supplying him with money to go there was to make him chargeable to it. For although it seems that Thomas Phillips had alleged that if he could only get to Bicester he was sure of obtaining employment, the Poor Law Commissioners do not collect that the directors and guardians of Marylebone took any steps to ascertain whether his statement was true or probable; and the Poor Law Commissioners think that no reliance ought to have been placed on the unupported statement of the pauper himself; and the effect of the course followed by the directors and guardians has been to make Thomas Phillips and his family chargeable to the parish of Bicester King's-end.",0

We do not mean to enter here into the much-vexed Sabbath question; for we believe that the most earnest respecter of the Sabbath would not object to a quiet stroll in a park or garden between the hours of worship.

This he knows from having had to value them, and observing their decreasing value since the parks were opened. The opening of the Dublin Zoological Gardens at the charge of one penny admission between church hours, was found to provide a powerful counter-attraction to the public house.

F. Sturmer, of the Rectory-house Academy, at Hayes, was, on Friday week, brought before the Magistrates at Uxbridge, charged with having occasioned the death of Joseph Alson, a fellow pupil, by having stabbed him in an altercation which had arisen between them. It appeared from the evidence of Mr. Sturmer, that the altercation arose on Saturday se’nnight between the prisoner and the deceased, the latter having called the former a thief and a blackguard, in consequence of some offensive observations having been applied by the prisoner to a pupil who had just quitted the establishment; the prisoner then struck the deceased over the shoulders with a stick; a scuffle ensued, and the deceased said the prisoner had struck him. Mr. Chadwick, a surgeon, was immediately sent for. The deceased said to the prisoner, ""I forgive you, we were both in the wrong."" An express was then sent off to a friend of the deceased, who, on his arrival, suggested that Mr. Patten, the surgeon at Uxbridge, should be sent for; Mr. Patten came on Sunday morning.

Cheney and Mr. Glanborne, [the rejected of Newport, Isle of Wight,] against Halford and Packe, the Tory Members in the late Parliament. The Castle-yard was densely crowded. The Chartists, in a firm phalanx, had possession of the central ground, in front of the hustings, first. Next came up the Tories on their left, and then the Whigs, with a band of about forty ruffians in white billy-cot tate, armed with bludgeons, on their right. The billy-cots exerted all their strength to break the central phalanx of Chartists; but the appearance of Cooper and Bairstow upon the hustings animated their zeal, and after a hearty volley of cheers, and a significant beckoning as to where the danger lay, a stout and effectual stand was kept up against the Whig ""billy-cots."" Finally, when the ruffians grew too impatient to be withheld from throwing the crowd into confusion, and made a desperate attempt on the centre, their hats were seized, and were seen flying and torn in all directions, and they were compelled to retreat. After the nomination of the Tory and Whig candidates, Cooper and Bairstow were also nominated as the Chartist candidates; and when the show of hands was taken, the number were fully as much in their favour as in those of any of the other candidates.

Tithees were then to be adjusted, not abolished; and the Whig adjustment was a tithe rent charge. He supported the Whigs through thick and thin. He stood before the Trades' Political Union in the Arcs la Abbey-street as the Government candidate, threatening with loss of place every unfortunate clerk in office who should dare to vote against the Government: Daniel O'Connell, thus putting the very worst of Tory practices (corruption and perjury) into active operation.

In all civilised nations women have always taken an active share in these charities; indeed, if we include those employed in the subordinate duties of nurses, matrons, etc, the number of women actually engaged would much outnumber that of men. How large a part of the character of these institutions, and of the influence exerted by them upon society, is dependent upon this great body of women employed in them and connected with them, may readily be imagined. Yet it is certain, and admitted by all who have any acquaintance with the matter, that this influence at present is far from being a good one. It is well known how much the efficiency of women as managers or supporters of public institutions is impaired by the lack of knowledge and practical tact to second their zeal; and business men who have dealings with them in these relations are very apt to regard them as troublesome and uncertain allies, rather than as efficient co-workers. With those employed in the active care of the institutions the case is still worse; the very term hospital nurse conveys the idea of belonging to a degraded class.  How to obviate this great evil has become an important question. In England, where all public institutions, hospitals—civil and military—workhouses, houses for reforming, prisons, penitentiaries, etc, form a great system, dealing with the poorer classes to an immense extent, and having a social importance too serious to be overlooked, the question has assumed sufficient weight to be discussed earnestly by government and the public at large.

The brisk state of trade in France has caused the exportation of machinery to be extremely active; two 42-quarter bobbin net machines went on Saturday night; and on Tuesday, a 15-quarter was loaded at Snenton in open day. Since the publication of the Manchester letter, though it states that the Government will not grant licenses for lace and flax machinery, yet from all we can perceive, the law is in abeyance, and is in fact abrogated. A memorial upon the subject to the Boards of Trade is in course of signature. The silk glove trade is in the most deplorable state, and nothing is heard amongst the hands but distress and lamentation. The beggging system is again in full activity.

He was instructed to say that the prisoner had followed a respectable trade at Liverpool, prior to this unfortunate occurrence. He was a shipwright, and for many years belonged to the Liverpool Shipwrights Association, which could be proved by the card of membership found on him, and an authorized document signed by upwards of a hundred members of the society giving him an excellent character.—W. Castles, the superintendent of the railway-station, said that he saw the prisoner with a well-dressed lad on the platform just as the train came in. Having some suspicions about them, he watched them at a little distance, and saw the lad steal a purse from a lady and hand it to the prisoner. He instantly seized hold of the latter, and found two purses in his hand, and while securing him the youth escaped. The two ladies then came up, and told him they had been robbed, and identified the purses and contents as their property.—The chairman said the prisoner's conduct had been extremely bad in training up youths to thieve, consequently the court felt bound to pass a heavy sentence on him as an example to others. He having been in good circumstances made his case worse, as he ought to have known better; therefore the sentence of the court was that he be transported for ten years. Just as the sentence was passed considerable confusion took place in court, owing to two females (supposed to be the prisoner's mother and his wife) screaming in a dreadful manner, calling for mercy",0

He promises to present a motion in the Assembly on this subject, a step to which he has been encouraged by the favourable reception given by the House to his plan. But before recurring to this measure, he wishes to secure the cooperation of the syndics. He reminds them that, by the law of March, 1832, heavy fines and imprisonment may be inflicted on editors who publish inaccurate accounts of the sittings of the Parliament, or courts of law, and the same editors may be interdicted, for a limited term, from giving any reports whatever of those proceedings. It is true the rigours of the law sleep, but they may, at the least expected moment, start into application. The number of the daily papers which report the sittings is about twenty. Each has one or two short-hand reporters. M. Girardin proposes to select the ten best reporters to make one report for all the papers. Thus there would be a great economy of labour, and a much more efficient result. The short-hand reporters thrown out of employment by this arrangement, he proposes to engage as reporters in the courts of justice. Finally, he invites the syndics to hold a meeting to discuss the matter, and promises to answer all the arguments that are brought against the scheme.

It was argued, that when we took into account the number of mechanics that the making of machinery had set to work; the number of iron makers; of workers in other metals; of workers in wood; of distributors of the productions of machinery; of the sailors, to carry those productions to other climes; and of the ship-builders, &c. &c. it was contended that when the argument was made to embrace all these, as by right it ought to do, we should find that the Results of Machinery had been to call into play a great amount of human labour and not to displace it.",0

The inhabitants of the parishes in which the burial-grounds were closed would have the same rights of interment in the new grounds as they had in their own burial grounds, and, to provide for the natural wishes of persons to be buried near the bodies of their own relatives, power would be given to remove, without the expensive process called a ""faculty,"" bodies from the intramural places of interment into the new grounds. The persons who were to superintend the execution of the act were to be empowered to provide, within the limits of the district, places of reception to which the poor (who were now severely endangered by the continuance of the bodies of their deceased relatives in the rooms occupied by the living) might have the corpses removed. A great practical difficulty in extramural interment was the removal of the bodies to a distant cemetery; especially in the cases of the poor; and it was therefore proposed to empower those appointed to execute the act to provide means (of which all who chose might avail themselves) for conveying bodies to the places of interment, and for conducting the funerals, at specified and moderate rates of payment. A large portion of the incomes of some of the London clergy was derived from fees on burials; and it was therefore only just and fair that provision should be made for affording compensation to them and to other persons whose incomes might be affected by this measure.

It seems that a rate collector had conceived, for some reason, a pique against a rate-payer, and that he consequently, knowingly and wilfully, set down in his books and demanded from the rate-payer a considerably higher sum than he was fairly or legally entitled to demand. This is proved by the collector's own admission. The man demurs to the payment of an extravagant charge and is summoned: the Magistrates having heard the case decide that the collector has acted improperly; they fix the amount to be paid at 6s. less than the Collector demanded, but they throw the expenses of the summons on the injured rate-payer. So, here is a man not only robbed of his time in having to leave his ordinary business and attend the Court for the purpose of resisting an unjust and villainous demand, but he is also robbed of four shillings, for being allowed to prove that the demand is unjust. That is, in plain terms, the Magistrates rob the man of four shillings for allowing him to prove before them that the Collector had tried to rob him of 6s. Now if we suppose that the man spent half a day in running after this piece of villainy, and value that half day at half a crown; add that to the four shillings costs, and the obtaining of justice, besides subjecting him to a large share of annoyance, cost him sixpence more than submitting quietly to be robbed in the first instance.

This is under the plea of economy, but it is hardly observed that in very many subdivisions the receipts of each court would pay for two judges—an Englishman and a native—and pension of the retiring Moonsiff. The real truth is, the civilians prefer having Moonsiffs and Amlaahs as subordinates, instead of finding near them uncoerced English judges in an independent capacity.

As the complainant seemed to be rather unacquainted with London life, witness determined to watch him to the steamer in which he was about to depart for Ireland, and had not gone far when he observed the complainant and the prisoner go into a public-house, where the former laid down upon the table the four sovereigns, and the prisoner took up three of them, stating that he would take the owner to Dublin and keep his money safe for him.

The principle on which the amount of remuneration for labour is estimated generally, is very erroneous, and is never resorted to in other business transactions, except where it is unavoidable. The price of labour ought to be in some proportion or affinity to the amount of wealth or increased value which labour creates. For example—if a piece of timber was of less value in the solid log than after being converted into plank by the operations of the saw, the increased price is the amount of wealth created by the labour of the sawyers—whose compensation should be a proportion and share of that wealth.  The same principle holds good through all the multifarious and complicated concerns of manufacture, in which the operations of labour are employed. Instead of the workmen being paid in any proportion of the amount of value created by their labour, the rate of wages is generally estimated according to the demand for labour, or in accordance with the number of workmen required, and the quantity of work to be performed; and as there is generally",0

No sincere Christian can doubt the importance of whatever has a tendency to kindle a spirit of fervour, and to rouse that feeling of inward devotion, without which the mere outward forms of worship become not only mechanical, but no longer acceptable to our heavenly Father, who must be worshipped in “spirit and in truth.” It becomes, therefore, a question for our consideration, what are the means best adapted for cherishing the pure flame of rational devotion and thanksgiving. In this connexion it is that I regard the importance of that delightful branch of our religious services, which receives the soul-inspiring aid of poetry. It is this which has added sublimity wherever she has been associated, and in proportion as her influence has been felt, she has united refinement to the exalted pleasures of religious adoration. With this conviction, we surely cannot too highly prize the admirable effusions of those excellent men who have - thereby so nobly served the cause of piety and virtue. Who then can reflect on many of the beautiful productions of Doddridge, or read the simple measures of Watts, without regretting that we are not permitted to enjoy them till they have passed the ordeal of the modern refinery?

The mise en scene of the coup d'état had been prepared in such a manner as to appear directed exclusively against the Royalist parties. There was in the first proclamation of Louis Bonaparte a phrase very little remarked until now, and yet, in my opinion, of very great importance: Louis Bonaparte blamed the conduct of the two parties in the Legislative Assembly, conduct which had been persisted in, he said, notwithstanding the patriotism of three hundred members. These three hundred members were the Republicans in the Assembly, in whom was personified the whole of their party without. Afterwards the Republicans were crushed, and if the old parties have not been altogether spared, they have at least only suffered insignificant oppression. But, at first, they appeared exclusively menaced, exclusively attacked: in appearance there existed the most complete accord between the new Dictator and the leaders of the Democracy. This was a contemptible calculation, an infamous absurdity; for the event has clearly proven that that bargain was never accepted or offered, from the very simple reason that it was radically impossible. But it suffices for a moment, an appearance, a suspicion to plant irresolution in the minds of the people, irresolution which, when once produced, is rapidly developed, and grows in spite of every opposition.",0

Is there a man, whatever his political creed, whose heart is not touched with compassion for the martyrs to their faith? And shall we, whose sympathies, were their sympathies, deny them the tribute of our tears—of our consolation! It would be impossible to give any artificial coloring to the living wretchedness with which, day after day, we are made acquainted.

A few days ago this distinguished military chieftain started on a professional tour through the central and western States, to explore the country and settle upon a site which, in his judgment, was best adapted for a military hospital, the Congress of the United States having appropriated a large sum of money for the purpose of establishing such an institution in the central portion of the Union, contiguous to a large number of our military forts, and the commission for the execution of the law having been conveyed to General Scott, as the Commander-in-Chief of the American army.

But, at the same time, everybody knows that it is quite possible that he may have been influenced by existing events and circumstances; for it is quite evident that during the last week, while he has been on this tour of observation, he has taken occasion to stop long enough at Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and other large towns, to make addresses to his fellow-citizens, when this period are likely, from political feeling, to extend to him an unusually warm and enthusiastic reception. General Scott understands the geography of this country and its political history too well not to know that the whole of the western valley of the great basin of the Ohio and the Mississippi is thickly scattered over with men who fought under his banner in the war of 1812, in the various contests we have had with the Indian tribes, and more particularly in the Mexican campaign.

The imports of all kinds of foreign grain, as well as the receipts of oats from Ireland, were, the time of year considered, limited. Fresh up to-day very little wheat reached us either by land carriage or sample, yet the show of English parcels, many of which were on offer on this day se'nnight, was on the whole rather extensive. The rumours in circulation, to the effect that an alteration in the present Corn Laws is in contemplation, had a most extraordinary effect upon the demand for wheat of home produce. The attendance of both town and country buyers was large, yet the uncertainty which the above rumour produced caused them to act with considerable caution. In some instances the holders demanded, though they did not obtain, an advance in the quotations of English wheat of from 2s. to 3s. per quarter; others, on the contrary, were disposed to sell at that amount of depression; hence it will be observed, we had much difficulty in ascertaining the exact state of the trade. However, we may observe that the finest qualities (though the trade must be called a dull one) were, in most instances, disposed of at prices about equal to this day sennight; but the middling and inferior kinds must be considered from 1s. to quite 2s. per quarter cheaper than on that day.

In the First Napoleon's character there was a certain greatness; at least he possessed genius, and had his arms been allied with ours, we might not now have carried on war for a year with nothing to show for it but a justification in the Moniteur. Charles James Fox, however, would not have admired him for his lawlessness alone, even had he possessed a face like a leaden mask—such as was enjoyed by that soleitor who used to be retained, in spite of his dulness, to stare Enskine out of countenance. But the First Consul himself never won the best men of France to his cause. He left France diminished in territory, disgraced by two invasions, depopulated, demoralised, though he stamped with his name some of the splendid civil projects of the Convention.

(Hear.) If you look at the stimulus given, partly through the extreme facility of credit to great undertakings during the years 1837 and 1838, to the connexion which existed between the Companies and Directors of Joint Stock Banks, and the manufacturing establishments—if you look to the immense efforts that were then made for the increase of our manufactures, to the numerous buildings that were then erected for the reception of the labourers in our manufactures, to the emigration of labourers from the rural districts into the manufacturing districts, to the immense increase which took place in the mechanical power of our manufactures, the consequence of the stimulus given to the manufactures in 1837 and 1838—you can hardly be surprised that those consequences should have followed those exertions which have so frequently followed similar exertions at former periods. (Hear, hear.) The same causes which were in operation here were in operation in the United States, at the same time; and the same consequences to the commercial interests there, in a greater degree, have been the result, while the derangement in the monetary affairs of the United States has acted most powerfully on the demand for our manufactures in that country. Concurrently with that exitemt and stimulus, and with the depression that followed from them, there has been an interruption in our amicable relations with that country, causing a considerable deficiency in the export of manufactured goods at a recent period, as compared with a former period of our intercourse with that country.

So monstrous does this assertion appear to me that I shall take the liberty of referring to the words of the President's Message relative to the subject. The extract is of the following nature ""In enforcement of the laws and treating stipulations of Great Britain, a custom has threatened to grow up on the part of her cruisers of subjecting to visitation ships sailing under the American flag, which, while it seriously involves our maritime rights, would subject to vexation a branch of our trade which was increasing, and which requires the fostering care of the Government; and although Lord Aberdeen, in his correspondence with the American Envoy in London, expressly renounced any right to detain American ships in the high seas, even if crowded with slaves, and limits the British pretensions to a mere claim of visit and inquiry; yet, it could not be well discerned by the executive of the United States how such visit and inquiry could be made without detention and the consequent interruption of our trade. It was regarded as the right of search, presented only in a new form and in different words."" That was the view which the President of the United States took of the question, which he treated as equivalent to the right of search which was at once given up by Lord Aberdeen. The statement of the American President created great excitement among parties who take an interest in the suppression of the slave-trade; and the subject is one which calls for an explanation from the Government. I will say for myself at once, that I entertain not the slightest doubt what the answer of our Government will be. I have not the slightest doubt but that they will tell us they have made no concession upon that subject to the Government of the United States. I believe that no",0

Here an address was read by Sir Francis Scott, in the course of which it was remarked:—  ""In addition to the historical interests and kindly reminiscences of Aston Hall, and the picturesque features of its architecture, which will at once be appreciated by your Majesty and your Royal Consort, we venture to bespeak your Majesty's kind interest in the peculiar circumstances under which the park and hall have been purchased.  ""In some towns in your Majesty's dominions, public parks have wisely been provided by wealthy corporations; in others by the munificence of philanthropic citizens; here, also, we are indebted to private liberality for two places of recreation for the people; but to Birmingham alone has it been given to secure, by her own exertions an ancient park for the physical relaxation —an ancient hall for the mental cultivation—of her variously employed and laborious population.  ""Your Majesty will, we believe, be gratified to learn that Aston Hall and Park have been secured, for the most part, by the industry and economy of the people themselves. Of the money required for this purpose, a very large proportion has been subscribed by the working classes, a circumstance which, we venture to hope, will not be without interest and satisfaction to your Majesty.""",0

The Free-traders are right when they say that monopoly restricts production. But that mere free trade will not suffice for the regulation of industry is proved, not merely by the fact that all who are really subjected to it, cry out; and still more by the fact, that no party really permits free trade to be thoroughly enforced; least of all, would the Manchester men permit it. The principle of Free-trade is, that trade be ""left alone,"" to work out itself. Now, let that principle be fully enforced, and there would be no law for the protection of capital against combinations of the working classes to keep up wages. Carry out the principle fully, and there ought to be no laws for the protection of credit, which ought to rest solely upon its natural and sole substantial basis, the confidence between man and man, and not in the unsubstantial basis of fictitious laws. But poll the Manchester school, and we suspect that you would find scarcely a vote given for that complete exclusion of the Free-trade principle. In the meantime, the partial Free-trade, which the professed advocates of full free trade enforce, inflicts loss and injury on all classes veritably exposed to it, because no class is exposed to it with perfect impartiality and fairness.",0

The poet before us proves how much the earlier efforts of the author were imbued with true poetic feeling. The notes exhibit a learning that is surprising when the writer's history is taken into account. And yet this self-acquired learning is but one of the many singular features that characterise the productions of this singularly gifted man, a poet of Nature's own making, whose extraordinary genius cannot fail, ere long, to exhibit still higher manifestations of its powers and versatility.”—Kentish Independent.  “ A clever fellow is our Thomas, the Chartist, full of rough common sense, and as much imagination as could possibly find room in a head so crammed with the hard knotty problems of politics. On the present occasion he has essayed, in his own peculiar way, a metrical story, which, although at times uncouth enough, is written with a heartiness that forms a pleasant relief to the namby-pamby rhymes of most of our poets who have sung of the moon and stars above, and the streams with the flowers below; till ordinary folks are sick and tired of hearing of them. We have not for a long time met with a volume of poetry that we could read through with half as much pleasure.”—Charter's Literary Register.",0

When the Bishop has done this, when he has established man's infallibility, he will have proved the excellence of Free Trade; he will have done more; he will have demonstrated the usefulness of his own order.  I believe that man is a fallen, selfish, ignorant being, and that every unregulated and unrestrained action of his is fraught with evil—that, if left with out the restraining and regulating laws of God (which, by our Constitution, must be part and parcel of the laws of the land), instead of preferring such schemes, in the search of his own advantage, as would be advantageous to the society, his selfishness would lead him to injure all for his own benefit. I learn this from the Holy Bible. I have often witnessed it. I am not to be convinced against Bible truth, and every day's experience, by Sir Robert Peel's declaration that Mr. Cobden has established a contrary truth; or by Mr. Cobden's assertion that Dr. Adam Smith has ""clearly demonstrated"" another fact; or by the Bishop of Oxford's doctrine enunciated in these awful words—""Be he labourer or be he farmer, what is it that makes him valuable to those above him?

The 7th and 8th of Victoria conferred on aliens who were married to British born subjects, but it did not deprive them of any privilege previously conferred on them by act of parliament, if possessed by them at common law. No prisoner could be divested of the privilege in question without the authority of parliament. The learned counsel then referred to the case of _doe dem_ Francis Ackland in support of his view.  After some further discussion, the Cnief Baron said that the Act of Victoria was a complete answer to the application; but he was not disposed then to lay down any general rules on the subject without more consideration. By that statute, however, a foreign lady by marrying a natural born subject becomes naturalised—the quality of an alien disappears, and she becomes an Englishwoman. It appeared to him, therefore, right that the trial ought to proceed.  Mr. Ballantine replied that the plea of the female prisoner that she was an alien, and ought to be tried by a jury _de medietate lingu_, should be entered on the record. [This application is, no doubt, made for the purpose of obtaining a writ of error, to be argued before all the judges.]  The Attorney-General objected to the proposed endorsement on the back of the indictment.

This same Robert Raikes, it may be remembered, was a printer of Gloucester, and it is by no means an insignificant coincidence that as, in an earlier day, a printer under the shadow of Westminster Abbey had set up the first printing press in England, and had thus laid the foundation of that wide circulation of the Bible and of religious literature which ultimately made the Sunday School a possibility, so, two centuries later, it was a printer, again who, in a provincial cathedral city, took a chief part in planning the system which is now the subject of such general interest throughout the country. Raikes was, like his father, not only a printer but a journalist—in fact, the elder Raikes was the founder of the Gloucester Journal. The education which the old newspaper proprietor gave his son was not only technical as far as his trade was concerned, but sufficiently general to enable him to contribute to literature, and the files of the paper testify to his ability in this respect, although, with the modesty which seems to have been one of his characteristics, he did not sign any of his contributions on the work of Sunday Schools which he so materially helped to promote. It was perhaps by something more than a further strange coincidence that on Monday last, when the Sunday School Centenary was formally inaugurated in the centre of the great city, it fell to the lot of another printer, as the chief magistrate for the year, to welcome to the Guildhall the Primate of the English Church and many men eminent in other",0

A little knowledge is better than no knowledge at all. (Cheers.) The more knowledge a man has, the better; but if his time and the means at his disposal do not permit of his acquiring deep and accurate knowledge, let him have as much as he can, and, depend upon it, he will be all the better for it. (Continued applause.) We may be told that we shall make him a mere smatterer in knowledge, to which I reply, that it is better for a man to be a smatterer than to be ignorant and uninstructed. There are many lines of information which it is most essential for a working man to pursue, but from which, were it not for institutions such as this, he would be helplessly excluded.

His Lordship added that he would not only have the working man study matters of science, but would have him exercise his mind by occasionally reading works of imagination and fancy, such as poems and romances, which ""are useful by giving buoyancy to the intellect, and inspiring the mind with noble sentiments.""

On reaching the inn the party was received by Mrs Smith, the hostess, and the first act of the ex-King was to call for writing materials. 'I wish,' he said, 'to write to the Queen, to inform her of my safe arrival.' He then wrote, in a very short time, more than one letter, and enclosed them in one envelope, which he addressed to her Majesty. With this dispatch Mr Iron instantly hastened to town. So destitute were the fugitives of what was necessary, that Mr Iron was commissioned to return with several articles of under clothing, dressing-cases, &c.  The party having partaken of a little wine and biscuit, a London paper was brought, over which Louis Philippe glanced. He had previously sent to Brighton for Mr Packham. This gentleman was at one time very much in the confidence of his Majesty respecting several engineering projects, being a miller and a tenant of the king, on an estate near to the Chateau d'En. He has since retired from business, and resides at Brighton, but was, up to last week in constant communication with the king. Indeed, he was closeted with Louis Philippe at the commencement of the outbreak, and on making some remark respecting it, the king exclaimed, 'Oh, it is nothing—it will soon blow over.'",0

G. Taylor, Hill-mill, Halliwell; and we regret to say that the consequence proved fatal to a young man named Thomas Halliwell, aged nearly nineteen, an engine tender. The deceased had been four years assistant in the engine house, and was a steady industrious workman. The boiler burst with a loud crash, destroying the engine house in a moment, and burying the deceased amid the ruins. All hands were soon on the spot, and after removing the bricks and the stones, the body of the unfortunate man was found quite lifeless. He was dreadfully scalded and disfigured; and presented a miserable aspect. Mr. Taylor's mill being furnished with an excellent water-wheel; steam power, we understand, is only used there occasionally. The boiler was in admirable condition, and the accident can be attributed to no other cause but an excess of steam, or a deficiency of water. The damage amounts to £150 or £200; but the mill, we are informed, will recommence work on Monday next. But there is a providence even in such calamities as these, for the explosion took place during the breakfast half-hour. An inquest was held on the body at the Lamb Inn, Sharples, on Thursday afternoon, before Mr. W. S. Rutter; and a respectable jury, of which Mr. J. Thwaites was foreman. The jury were of opinion that the accident had been occasioned by over-firing in consequence of the steam being low; the death of the deceased was quite accidental, and no blame could be attached to any party.",0

The priest who performed the ceremony was the Rev. Mr. Jones, and the real sufferer, Jones, appeared in the witness-box, and stated that the prisoner had made her a good husband, and had been an excellent father to her child. The jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict of Guilty. The Recorder, in passing sentence, remarked upon the circumstances of the prisoner having contracted the second marriage under the assumed name of Thorne, as indicative of a perfect knowledge that his wife was alive, and also of a conciliated fraud. Looking at the whole of the case, the sentence of the Court was, that the prisoner be imprisoned in the House of Correction for six calendar months, but without hard labour.",0

The circumstances of the case are as follows—In the month of November, 1836, Denis Doyle, the deceased, was on his way from a market in the county of Cavan, when he was met by two persons, who attacked and killed him on the spot. Two men were accused at the time, and both of them fled the country, and nothing was heard of either of them until, a few days since, information was sworn against the parties at the time, and Patrick Murphy was one of the accused. A few days since it was ascertained that he was a soldier in the 5th Fusileers, and then the warrant was issued for his apprehension, and on Inspector M'Cann and the constable making inquiry after him at the barracks, he was at once given up into their custody. It is said the evidence against him is very strong. He was in the regiment for the last seven years, and appears to be about twenty-six years of age. He was transmitted with the head constable to Cavan, to take his trial for the crime imputed to him. The other person accused, it is said, made his escape to America.

She, however, rejected his offers, and took an opportunity of running out of the house while he was engaged with a customer in the shop.—Mr. Cottingham, perceiving that both the complainant's eyes were discoloured and swollen, asked her the cause, and she replied that it was from blows given her by the prisoner when she was struggling with him. She further stated that on getting out of the prisoner's room, in her hurry, she found that she had put on one of his shoes and one of her own, and that when she got home she informed her mistress of all that had happened to her.

The statements made by Orsini, in answer to the interrogatories, must, however, be here reproduced, I said.  From my youth I have only had one object, and one fixed idea—the deliverance of my country, and vengeance against the Austrians; and I have conspired against them up to 1848. At that period, I naturally took part in the war. We had then always regarded the French as brothers and friends, and, when they landed at home, we welcomed them as allies, but they soon showed themselves bitter enemies; we then repulsed them, and took many of them prisoners. After three or four days, reflecting that France was the most civilized of nations, and that perhaps she had been led away against her will, we thought it our duty to act wisely and generously, and we released the prisoners amidst cries of 'Vive la France!' 'Vive l'Italie!' 'Vive la liberté Italienne!' It was quite a national fête. What did the French then do? They suspended hostilities, but it was only to wait for reinforcements. The French then overwhelmed us with perfect safety, for they were a hundred to one; we could not resist, and the élite of the Italian youth was sacrificed.

It appear that the second floor of Mr. Featherston's house is let out as lodgings. It was upon the floor in the front room that flames were seen issuing from the windows by City-police constable 402. It was shortly ascertained that the occupier of the rooms was from home, and that no one was in, and the door fastened. Adjoining the floor, as we understood, there were three children in bed, and the utmost exertions were made to secure them. This was done with considerable difficulty, and the children taken into a public-house opposite. The parish engine having arrived, a plentiful supply of water was obtained, and Mr. Fogo, from the Farringdon-street station of the fire brigade having arrived, with their powerful engine, an entrance was speedily made into the premises, and streams of water poured upon the fire. In less than twenty minutes the fury of the flames was checked, and by half-past nine all danger was at an end. The damage done is considerable; the furniture is consumed, and the valuable stock of Mr. Featherston much damaged. The house also is extensively burnt, and it is quite certain that not less than £200 will cover the loss sustained by the several parties. How the fire originated is unknown.

He answered, that he had done nothing of the kind. The learned judge observing that this was inconsistent with his present plea, desired that he should be apprised, that from the depositions there could be no doubt of his having acted as described.

It was the first time that Mr. Gale had ever made such an ascension, and his pony had only a few days before been broken in. At first the little animal displayed great repugnance at being lifted from his feet, but he gradually got accustomed to it, and on Sunday allowed himself to be carried off by the balloon with the greatest composure. As there was some delay in filling the balloon with gas, the pony, gaily saddled and bridled, was paraded round the Hippodrome, and was regarded with extraordinary curiosity by the spectators. An immense multitude assembled to witness the ascent. The local journals say that the town was completely deserted, and that the adjacent villages sent their contingents. When Mr. Gale was seen to ascend rapidly into the air, seated on his pony, with the bridle in one hand and saluting the public with the other, there was a sort of shudder of fear in the vast gathering. The pony was perfectly calm, with his legs hanging and the neck bent; but he made no movement. The descent of Mr. Gale, which took place at a short distance from Bordeaux, was near being fatal to him.

It will, therefore, be found very useful to possess a work like that of Mr. Thornton, which, in its present condition, affords in a compact and cheap form, and in so much detail, the history of English India. It is one advantage and one disadvantage of this work that a single chapter is alone dedicated to the pre-English history of India, while it is a more serious disadvantage that it closes with the governorship of Lord Ellenborough in 1844. To have added so much new matter would, of course, have altered the scope of the work, and prevented its production on terms more necessary to the mass of readers. Some will be better satisfied that Mr. Thornton has abstained from this recent portion, for his position as an official of the Company, has as much tendency to expose him to the suspicion of bias, as it gives him a claim to the possession of accurate and authentic information. One consequence of a cheap edition is, that the notes and references are suppressed, but one feature of the old work is preserved, and that is a copious index. The glossary of Indian terms has been extended, though Mr. Thornton avoids the use of Indian terms where English terms will correctly express the idea, and here is likewise a chronological index, and altogether the work has most of the materials required for reference or for self-study.",0

Colney Hatch was opened in 1851; within a period of less than five years it became necessary to appeal to the rate-payers for further accommodation; and recent returns show that there are more than one thousand pauper lunatics belonging to the county unprovided for in any of its asylums. What has been going on in the metropolitan county has been going on more or less throughout the whole country. Additional accommodation for the insane has been provided, and further accommodation is still required. We must make allowance for two things to be taken into consideration in inferring, from the increased demand for asylums for the insane, an actual increase in the numbers afflicted with the malady: namely, the great improvement that has taken place during the last twenty years in the management of asylums, and the consequently increased desire to place the insane in institutions where every chance of recovery is afforded them; and the accumulation of chronic cases: the proportion of curable cases of insanity being something like one in five. Still, making allowance for these things, a large progressive increase in the number of lunatics is apparent. By a comparison of the returns of pauper lunatics and idiots, made by the Poor Law Board in the years 1852 and 1857 respectively, it is found that the numbers in the former year were twenty-one thousand one hundred and fifty-eight, and in the latter, twenty-seven thousand six hundred and ninety-three, showing an increase of six thousand five hundred and thirty-five in five years.

Willis was tried for the offence last year, and transported for fifteen years. Mr. Maguire, the following day, went to the spot which the prosecutor had described as the scene of this most barbarous attack, and there found a large quantity of blood, and also three hedge-stakes, of about 4 yard long and 6 inches round. Mr. Jones, the surgeon, described the wounds, and said that when he visited the prosecutor at the chapelhouse at Hetton he found the left nasal and cheek bones fractured, the left eye dangerously wounded, and the left side of the head bruised; and that there appeared as well to be concussion of the brain. Mr. Walesby addressed the jury for the prisoners. Lord Denman summed up, and the jury, after a short delibration, returned a verdict of Guilty against both the prisoners. The learned Judge, in passing sentence, said that the prisoners had been convicted of one of the worst assaults he had ever heard of in a court of justice. It was most fortunate indeed for them that the dreadful injuries they had inflicted did not cause death, or they would then have stood at the bar capitally convicted. Though no fatal result had ensued, there could be no doubt that morally they were even now guilty of murder.

The demeanour having alighted from the car in a very low state, a restorative draught was administered to him, after which he was conducted to the scaffold. There, on his fetters being struck off, he knelt down with the accompanying priest and prayed. The chief of the Braunsberg tribunal then read the sentence, which ordered the execution by breaking on the wheel from below upwards, and closed with an address to the three executioners present in these words—""And now I deliver him to you for the due fulfilment of this judgment.""  On hearing this the malefactor looked round to the priest, sank again on his knees, and ejaculated a short prayer. Then rising, he laid himself, with calm resolution, on the scaffold, and, refusing the assistance of the executioners, placed his limbs in the required position. This done, he said with a firm voice—""God have mercy on my poor soul!"" One of the executioners covered his face with a cloth. The terrible operation by the wheel now commenced.

Ninety-two were missing when all were got on board the Sarah, eight died on the passage to Fayal and one after we came to anchor. Of the ninety-two about thirty went off on the raft the day after the accident; forty perished from want of water and food; about twelve were drowned by the swamping of the quarter boat, and the remainder were probably smothered in their berths. All the cabin passengers were saved. The doctor reported four second cabin passengers among the lost. I regret that I do not know their names, nor those of any of the missing.

The inquest was very extended, continuing for upwards of seven hours, when the jury returned a verdict against Ford of Wilful Murder.  The murder has caused great consternation in the densely populated district in which it took place. Shaw was a native of Charlesworth, and died in the house in which he was born. He had no family. He had always borne a respectable character, and was reported an honest and industrious man. Ford is 24 years of age, is by trade a carpenter, and native of Liscard, County of Waterford.

The opinions there expressed are, as will be seen, singularly bold, when we consider the rigorous censorship that is exercised on the French press. The writer observes:—""O'Donnell is at this moment master of the position. He can lean on his long sabre, and gaze on the ruins which still smoulder, whilst saying:—All this acknowledges me. But does this victory, so dearly purchased, promise to Spain a regular Government? does it promise to the victor a long possession of power—a Government? On this point our doubts exist. As long as the laws are suspended, the Cortes dispersed, the national militia disarmed—as long as the dictatorship continues—we may question the re-establishment of the constitutional rule in Spain. And yet it is said that this rule is the one meditated by O'Donnell. But we are all aware of the value and of the destination of good intentions. Let us, however, hasten to say that the Government of O'Donnell does not appear to incline towards constitutional liberties. Where are any symptoms that correspond with the intentions attributed to him? Do they, perhaps, exist in his attitude towards the press? At this moment the Spanish press is treated in a manner that corresponds with anything but liberty. The general march of the Cabinet is at the same time hostile to the idea of an approaching return to constitutional Government. With respect to the solution of the second problem—namely, the personal position of O'Donnell—it must be said that threatening clouds conceal the truth, and reduce us to conjectures. O'Donnell issued from a revolution, and bears, whatever he may do, unmistakable signs of his sad origin.

Articles thrown down upon the floor instantaneously kindled; the damp towels on the horse in a bedroom ignited; a handkerchief placed on a sofa burst into flame; a box containing articles of apparel was found suddenly alight; smoke issued from cupboards, from drawers, from unopened boxes; the very furniture appeared to be charged with some mysterious self-igniting gas. The house was several times in flames; but each time the conflagration was stopped in the bud. A jury was summoned to inquire into these strange facts; and the only apparent mode of accounting for them lay in the circumstance that, a few days before the first fire, some brimstone and charcoal had been burnt in one of the rooms to rid the house of vermin. It was shown that a portion of the sulphurous fluid escaped on the floor, and set fire to it; and it was suggested by several scientific men that the house had become charged with sulphurous fumes and charcoal gas, which took fire, in some cases by means of electricity, in others by friction. The verdict of the jury, as regards the first fire, was “Accidental”; and, as regards the rest, the verdict was open.—[Query: has another box been played off upon the daily press in this strange story?

He then bid us good bye, and in fifteen minutes or so he was out of sight. During the whole day the weather was extremely cold, and the sea very rough. We rigged a drag with our oars, in order to keep the boat's head to sea, and to break the force of the waves. Towards nightfall the mate consulted, in a low voice, with several of the crew about lightening the boat. I was aft at the time, with my back against the stern. At last he said to me and another man who was near me, ""Well, I suppose you have no objection to lend us a hand to lighten the boat?"" I enquired how he intended to do so, and, while I was speaking, I heard a splash alongside, and the whole boat was in an uproar—the work of death had commenced.

In the fourth edition of his Treatise on Life Assurance Societies, Mr. ARTHUR SCRATCHLEY, whose authority is beyond question, states that, up to the commencement of the present year, scarcely a quarter of a million of lives had been assured in the United Kingdom, though the population of England and Wales alone was nearly 18,000,000 in 1851, and was increasing at the rate of 200,000 a year. What stronger evidence is necessary, inquires this practical economist, to prove that the public does not yet fully understand the advantages of the assurance system, or that the majority of existing companies, from the manner in which they conduct their business, do not meet the practical requirements of the people? No doubt, many societies have been formed of recent years, which transact little business and incur large annual expenses; no doubt many are established and supported for the mere benefit of the managing director and his colleagues, the solicitor and physicians; but any one who will be at the pains to understand the subject, may test the responsibility of an assurance office. Others are started without good connexions, or with an insufficiency of paid-up funds; others are reckless in their expenditure, so that the second or third annual report disgusts the holders of policies and shares. But a serious mistake is prevalent with reference to the expenditure of speculative companies. The society must create a working machinery, must obtain a reputation, must plan its operations upon a large scale; it cannot afford to be penurious. Thus, to maintain that the disbursements of a young society which does a small business, should hold the same proportion to the receipts as the disbursements of an old society with a large income, is to prohibit the new office from advancing.",0

The crop of 1845 (adds the Prèss) is entirely exhausted, and that of 1846 has produced less than a fair average. The rye harvest has so completely failed throughout France, that it will scarcely produce sufficient for the ensuing year. Some farmers have not thrashed their crop, as they found it would not pay the expense. Wheat is, in general, of good quality, but, contrary to the expectation of the farmers, the produce is less than that of the year 1845. The oats have been scorched by the sun in several departments. They are inferior in quantity and quality everywhere, but particularly in the departments where they serve for the food of the inhabitants. Dry vegetables, such as peas, beans, and lentils, will not produce a sufficient supply for the ensuing winter. Cabbages and carrots are exceedingly scarce. Potatoes have been attacked with the prevailing disease in twelve departments, and cause serious apprehensions for the future. So much for France. Let us now examine the prospect in foreign countries. In Belgium there are no complaints of the harvest, but it will not produce any overplus for exportation. In Holland no decline in the price of provisions is expected. It is further said, that at the opening of the States General, the Government will demand an extension of the bill passed last year (to encourage the importation of foreign grain. Portugal is menaced with an approaching famine, and Spain is too poor to assist her neighbours. Switzerland will be compelled to seek provisions from abroad. Amongst the countries which commonly export corn, Pomerania has no wheat to spare. Mayence cannot suffice for the demands of Switzerland and of Alsace. Alexandria and Odessa have no wheat in their stores, and the prices were gradually rising even before the",1

I question, indeed, whether, in proportion as we are exempted from the inquisition of our fellow-men, the inquisition of conscience ought not to be more active. In the churches to which I have referred, a thoroughly honest man will not dare to cross the threshold without a strong intuition that he is distinctly called by Providence to the station he aspires to fill; the churches will doubtless suffer in consequence, by the excludsion of scrupulously conscientious candidates from offices; but which the professor and hypocritical will gain admisssion without difficulty; for the bar which effectually stops a good man",0

The 'new departure,' looked at from the outside, has a very ambiguous aspect; and that this ambiguity should be removed no one sincerely interested in education or the Board's well-being can for a moment doubt.

In Western Canada 100 acres of the best land in the empire can be bought for £40; in Lower Canada for £20. In New Brunswick, where there are still 11,000,000 of ungranted acres in the possession of the government, for £12 10s. In Nova Scotia, where land is now, in many districts, as valuable as in any of the colonies, and, from the increase of commerce, soon will be in all, we give 100acres of Crown land to an emigrant for £10.—Speech of the Hon. J. Howe.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMMON LAW AND EQUITY.—""Pray, my lord,"" said a gentleman to a late respected and rather whimsical Judge, ""what is the distinction between the law and equity courts?"" ""Very little, in the end,"" replied his lordship; ""they only differ so far as time is concerned. At common law you are done for at once; in equity, you are not so easily disposed of. The former is a bullet, which is instantaneously and most charmingly effective; the latter is an angler's hook, which plays with its victim before it kills it. The one is prussic acid, the other laudanum.""",0

Dear Sir,—Having been for a considerable time during the winter afflicted with a violent cough, particularly at laying down in bed, which continued for several hours in- cessantly, and after trying many medicines without the slightest effect, I was induced to try your Lozenges; and by taking about half a box of them, in less than twenty-four hours the Cough entirely left me, and I have been perfectly free from it ever since.

Holiday, a picture of great merit. Bareheaded, barefooted, and in his shirt, with halter round his neck, the patriot about to yield himself, in the words of old Froissart, ""purely to the will of the besieging king,"" bids adieu to his wife. His face is full of unbending resolution, and determination to bear up against his own grief, while a faint attempt to console is excellently indicated. The lady, on the other hand, is a true picture of passionate desolation. Hard by is Mr. Millais' ""Love of James I."" (No. 482). A great deal has been said, because this is the least obtrusive of the Associate's works, about its poetry and paramount excellence in point of drapery. Let those who think so enjoy their fond belief. The monarch is indicated by a hand outstretched from prison window. The lady-love is a tall, slim, ""impressive she."" Her rich blue robes certainly well painted, but is far outdone by the white stole of the burgess, which is provokingly hardy-for this odious comparison. Another grand landscape, this time by J. T. Linnell, hangs in the north-west angle of the room. It is called, ""A Thunder Shower."" The metallic glitter of the leaves under the thunder-cloud, and the delicacy of the cut hay, must be looked and wondered at. One of the most popular pictures this year is Mr. Hicks's (519), ""Dividend Day at the Bank."" Everybody can understand the scene and the characters; but, as a whole,",0

To criticise this classic of historical research would be an impertinence; even to add one word to the universal verdict appears a superfluous pretension. But we grieve for the honour of English literature that Mr. HALLAM's signal success should not have encouraged other students to walk in his footsteps. How few English names can we find to compare with that phalanx of French and German authors who have studied history as a science, who have searched its vast storchouses for the lessons of experience, and who have taught mankind that there are other conquests and purer glories than those of war. As a philosophical historian Mr. HALLAM still stands alone and unapproached by any of his own countrymen; indeed by few even of the Continental writers, with the exception of Sismondi and Guizot. He has not only told us what manner of subjects should form the ""eternal lessons of history,"" but has furnished an example to the students of future generations when our own noisy moments of time shall have become in its turn an exercise of research. We therefore hail with peculiar satisfaction Mr. Murray's new and improved edition of Mr. HALLAM's View of the State of Europe during that period of modern civilisation which we are pleased to call the Middle Ages, as if we had already attained the mysterious goal towards which mankind have been slowly advancing since the fall of the Roman Empire.

This is the quarter from which Narvaez is most seriously threatened—it is thence that he fears the breaking out of a confederation which may destroy the edifice of his fortune. At one time Espartero endeavoured to annihilate the revolutionary party, and at another time courted it. Narvaez, in like manner, endeavoured to crush this party, but would now be very glad to obtain its aid against the Carlists and the fraction of the Moderados who have united against him. To release Spain from foreign influence and Carlism, Espartero wished to marry the Queen to the eldest son of the Infante Don Francisco. To contend with any degree of advantage against the pretensions of the Count de Montemolina, Narvaez, it is said, has conceived the plan of giving the hand of Isabella to the second son of Don Francisco. Espartero, in fine, having discontented all parties, was successively abandoned by all, and even by the army. And what is now the situation of Narvaez? He has against him the Carlists, who have recovered from the effects of their long struggle, and are ready and willing to make new attempts; he has against him the Progressists, who will never pardon him for his atrocities towards them; he has against him a fraction of the Moderados, and also a certain number of generals. Who, then, has he on his side? The army. But who can tell how long the army may remain faithful to him? Constituted, as it has been, through the triumph of the Moderados, who knows whether Carlism may not find numerous adherents among its officers, and even among its soldiers?

He was in the act of running away, after having committed the cowardly assault, when he was pursued and taken into custody. The defendant said that the complainant was about to strike him for incidentally pushing against her, and that in warding off the blow her mouth came against his knuckles, but that he had no intention of hitting her.

At last I said something about it to a friend, a preacher, with a somewhat humorous turn. “You are very unfortunate,” said he; you have an Austrian official hat. Now this,” taking up a low-crowned, broad-brimmed hat, like one of the English “wideawakes,” the American “Californias,” “is ‘durchaus socialistischer und demokratischer,’ a thoroughly socialist and democratic hat, and would send me to the Austrian guardhouse if I should wear it in the streets. This however,” and he raised another with a more pointed crown and a narrower brim, “is merely a ‘schlecht-gesinnte hut,’—an evil-disposed hat.” This word “evil-disposed” has almost passed into a phrase in Hungary to mean anything which is opposed to the government, and of course, in consequence anything which the Hungarians like. “This again,” he continued, taking up a black hat, like the Kossuth hats in vogue here, “is a purely neutral hat; Hungarian, but not revolutionary. And this,” handing me mine, “is a thoroughly Austrian, well-disposed reactionnaire (reactionary hat).” This analysis of hats was amusing enough though it all speaks strongly, much more than more important facts, of the present condition of Hungary.—Bruce’s Hungary in 1851.

The scheme was this: X—— had bills of exchange for all sums and at all dates.

Those who are looking beyond the present moment to the termination of the war, when Italy freed from the Austrians, will have need of an army of one hundred and fifty thousand or two hundred thousand native soldiers to maintain her freshly won independence, justly count on the services of these national troops. It is with no small feeling of regret that they see the probability of those fine fellows—who were burning with desire to win their first laurels by the side of the Piedmontese and French armies—being drawn off from the battle-field where the fate of Italy is to be decided, in order to engage in a sort of guerrilla warfare in the Papal states where is but too probable that, imperfectly commanded, only half-trained, and exposed to the fearful influences of popular passions, they may become undisciplined and, perhaps, so imbued with the fury of party spirit, so maddened with revenge, as to be urged to vindictive acts, which may stain the hitherto unsullied annals of the Italian movement. Thus the affair of Perugia produces a grievous complication, and Rome has become responsible, not only for the innocent blood shed at Perugia, but for all that may hereafter be sacrificed, and for the deep moral deterioration inseparable from civil war, especially when that war is unhappily mixed up with what in this country becomes a religious question. Rome never took a more false step than this, so far as her own interests are concerned, and many who shudder at the recital of wanton barbarities secretly rejoice at seeing the hateful tyranny under which they have so long groaned receiving a death-wound from its own hand.

For himself, simple, ignorant, and innocent, he does no wrong that he knows to be wrong, and he cannot, therefore, understand the use of a dogmatic salvation for himself. Besides, the intellectual organization of a race must first be developed before it is possible to engraft anything of an intellectual doctrine on it. This is not to be done by mere instructive education, or by teaching a spiritual creed. Practical arts, social improvements, the stout administration of mild laws, the inculcation, by the influence of example and the moral pressure of superiority, of a purer code of morals—all this would civilize the negroes, but not the distribution of Bibles, or the insisting on a spiritual faith as the only guarantee of good.",0

He had come into the city upon horseback, and his nag was turned out to grass for a few hours. The horse, as may well be supposed, having such a master, was a brute of taste, and took it into his head that the grass, in a field belonging to our worthy corporation, which adjoined that in which it had been put, was of a better and sweeter flavour than its own allotment, and accordingly made good his lodgment there. The mayor impounded the horse, and next morning, when Burns heard of the disaster, he wrote the following stanzas:—  “Was e’er puir poet sae beffited, The maister drunk—the horse committed— Puir harmless beast! tak’ thee nae care, Thou’t be a horse when he’s nae Mayor.”  His worship’s Mayoralty, we should have presumed, was about to expire on the day on which the stanza was written; it is said, that when the Mayor heard whose horse he had impounded, he gave instant orders for its liberation, exclaiming, “let him have it, or the job will be heard of for ages to come.”",0

Should these Oxford Essays continue as they have begun they will form a valuable collection; and we think the editor is very judicious in selecting topics of permanent rather than of immediate interest. Many thoughtful men will consider it a great boon to be able to publish an essay on a subject, and not be forced to expand that essay into a volume. Published separately, an essay of fifty pages meets with small attention, and is, by the very nature of the case, neglected among pamphlets; but if bound up in a volume, the essay has great publicity to start with, and is always accessible hereafter.  Let us suppose, for instance, that Professor Max Müller had printed the Essay on Comparative Mythology in a separate form. It would not have been less valuable, it would not have been read with less eagerness, but it would have reached its audiences with great difficulty and after much expense, and having reached them, would have run all those risks of being mislaid which hang fatally over pamphlets and thin essays. It is a production which no one would willingly suffer to be huddled among heaps of neglected papers. It is something to be prized, and placed on shelves of honour. But, after all, a pamphlet of eighty pages will get mislaid, will slip between thicker pre-tensions, and fall down beneath more ponderous claims. In the Oxford Essays it runs no such risk. There it is secure of an accessible position.  A finer essay, richer in knowledge and in thought, we know not where to find. Professor Müller's enormous learning is carried lightly and with mastery, giving momentum to his intellect, not impeding it. Although no one would adequately treat such a subject as Comparative Mythology without great learning, philosophical and philosophical, it is unhelpfully but too",0

His mother gave me the shirt, which I now produce. The wristband and part of the sleeve were torn off and it was in the same state as now. I examined it and found on the left wristband blood. I afterwards found the part of a shirt sleeve which, on comparing it with the shirt, I found exactly corresponded with it. I also found some stockings belonging to the prisoner, Thomas Hocker, which were stained with blood. I told the father that I must take the things away, and he said, ""That is what I expected."" Prisoner's father then told me, that his son Thomas had informed him that he had borrowed £12 of Mrs. Edwards, of Bath-place, New-road, which he was ahead was not true; and wished me to ascertain whether it was true or not; he further said, the prisoner had given him a sovereign, but if his tale was not true, he would immediately give it up to me. I asked if his son had taken out a stick with him on the night of the murder, and he replied that he",0

By great force, I at length succeeded in getting him up. C. Collins, valet to Lord Maidstone, states that he was just leaving the Coach and Horses, opposite the hotel, when flames were bursting from the back part of Raggett's Hotel. As he well knew, and was well known on the premises, he ran in instantly, the people in the streets at the time joining in a general cry of ""Fire!"" Finding that the staircase was in flames, he went to the foot of it, and called as loudly as he could, shortly after which the screamings of persons in the upper rooms were dreadful. At this instant three ladies appeared at one of the drawingroom windows nearest the balcony. Being encouraged, they came out in their night dresses, and ladders being procured, they were taken in safety into the neighbouring houses. Collins, after rescuing a quantity of property and clothing belonging to Colonel Bouverie and others, which he lodged at the Coach and Horses opposite, was compelled to withdraw and leave the house and its contents to the fury of the flames, as the heat was too powerful for him. He saved eight or nine persons, the majority of whom were ladies. James Thompson, an omnibus timekeeper, was waiting at the time of the outbreak, in company with one of Mr. Hardwick's conductors, for the omnibus to Knightsbridge. He saw the first of the fire, and ran upstairs, the flames being then confined to the rear of the building. While there Lord Huntingdon cried out, ""Save my son!"" Thompson made the attempt, but could not undo the nursery door, the handle being so hot. He went round to the leads, and looked in at the window, but Lord",0

The first scene is Genevieve's little village shop is acted with delightful freshness by Madame Celeste and Miss St. George, the sudden termination of whose part at the first act's end was regretted by all who observed her intelligence during its progress.  In the various situations we have indicated as giving scope for the exercise of her peculiar gift of expression, Madame Celeste was quite herself and was rapturously applauded by great and small, young and old, critical and uncritical. The parts of Girard, the Provencal farmer, and his son Cyrille were thoroughly well sustained by Messrs. Barrett and Emery. The latter artist, whose costume exhibited that excellent sense of the picturesque for which he is so remarkable, rendered excellently the gaucherie and bashfulness of the peasant lover.

The fatal cases of typhus have declined to 45; those of diarrhoea and dy- sentery were 20; and only one death is returned as caused by cholera, and in this case the deceased sunk under debility, the consequence of two attacks of the disease which she had suffered previously. She was a woman of 27 years, and died in the south- sub-district of the City of London.

I had tried doctors and medicines of every kind, but all to no avail, indeed I daily got worse, and felt that I must shortly die. From seeing your remedies advertised in the paper I take it, I thought I would give them a trial. I did so. I rubbed the ointment in as directed, and kept cold leaves to the parts thickly spread with it, and took the Pills night and morning. In three weeks I was able to walk about for an hour or two in the day with a stick, and in seven weeks I could go anywhere without one. I am now, by the blessing of God and your medicines, quite well, and have been attending to my business for more than seven months without any symptoms of the return of my old complaint. Besides my case of Rheumatic Gout, there lately had proof that your Pills and Ointment will heal any old wound or ulcer, as a married woman, living near me, had had a bad leg for four years, which no one could cure, and I gave her some of your Pills and Ointment, which soundly healed it when nothing else would do it.

In 1839, what was called the 8th rule was established by which these religious books were forbidden to be read during the time of secular education, and not read if any parents objected; and it was said this meant that the books might be excluded if one parent objected. In the autumn of 1852, the Archbishop of Dublin found these books had never been read in the model school at Clonmel, and others. He complained to the board, differences arose, and a resolution, excluding these books, was come to by a majority of the board, and all combined religious education was abolished in the schools; accordingly, Mr. Blackburne, Baron Greene, and the Archbishop retired from the board. This case demanded imperatively Parliamentary inquiry, which was due to the retiring commissioners and the Protestants of Ireland. The Earl of Antrim, when first the notice of the noble earl was given, had intended to resist it because he thought it might throw a doubt on the value of that system which had bestowed such inestimable benefits on Ireland; but as the noble earl had entered on his task in no hostile spirit, but the contrary, he had thought it better to agree to the motion; and as there was to be an inquiry, he should enter into a discussion on the question.

About one o'clock on Sunday morning, a large Dutch East Indiaman, name unknown, came ashore on the coast of Pevensey, a little to the north-east of the Head, the wind blowing tremendously and the sea running mountains high. Eighteen of the crew out of two or three and thirty on board, succeeded in landing in safety in their own boat, and it appeared from their statement that the ship was bound from Batavia to Amsterdam, laden with a valuable cargo of coffee, sugar, and indigo. The greatest apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the captain of the vessel, who, steadfast to the trust reposed in him, remained on board with the mate and twelve or thirteen of the crew, but it was not until Sunday forenoon that any assistance could be afforded them. Their situation during that dreadful night, on such a shore, with a gale from the S.S.W., and the sea continually breaking over their ill-fated vessel, was truly awful. In the forenoon of Sunday, however, a small pleasure boat belonging to Perencey, manned by two pilots, named Pierce and Wood, and three of the coast guard, named Oliver, Warnell, and Fleming, put off to the assistance of the crew of the East Indian, and succeeded in reaching her.

She was not at first aware that she was wounded, and joined in the laughter of her companions on hearing the report; but at the same moment experienced a sensation of numbness down the side of her face which was streaming with blood, and was only saved from falling by a bystander, who supported her. Mr J. Maber, the divisional surgeon, who attended the complainant at the station, described the nature of the injury as a lacerated wound extending about seven inches from the centre of the right cheek into the back of the neck, where there was a corresponding orifice, through which the ball had evidently passed. He considered the wound to be of a very dangerous description. Several other witnesses were examined, and fully corroborated the complainant's account of the transaction. The prisoner, in his defence, declared that it was his firm belief at the time that the gun was not loaded, and that the result was purely accidental. Mr Hammill ordered the prisoner to be fully committed upon the charge, but consented to accept bail.  JUVENILE DEPRAVITY.—Anne Watts, twelve, and her brother, James Watts, fourteen, were finally examined, charged with robbing Eliza Jenkinson, aged nine.

One of Germany's leading newspapers, the Augsburger Allgemeine, has published a startling article on the depopulation of Ireland. The article, which was written by the paper's correspondent in Dublin, paints a grim picture of the state of the Irish population. According to the article, the Irish population is in decline, with the birth rate falling and the death rate rising. The article also highlights the problems faced by the Irish economy, which is struggling to cope with the effects of the depopulation.  JOSEPH HUMPHRIES, ESQ., the Master of the Irish Bench, has been appointed to the position of Lord Chancellor of Ireland. The appointment was made by Queen Victoria, and is a recognition of Mr. Humphries' long and distinguished career in the legal profession. Mr. Humphries is a highly respected lawyer, and his appointment is seen as a sign of the Queen's confidence in his abilities.  THE SEARCH FOR MR. FRANKLIN. Recent voyages to the Polar Regions have brought to light a great deal of information about the Arctic and Antarctic regions. However, one of the greatest mysteries of the Arctic is the disappearance of the famous explorer, Sir John Franklin. Sir John Franklin set out on an expedition to the Arctic in 1845, but he and his crew were never seen again. The search for Sir John Franklin has been a long and difficult one, but recent advances in technology and knowledge of the Arctic have led to a renewed interest in the search. It is hoped that the latest expeditions will be able to shed some light on the mystery of Sir John Franklin's disappearance.  THE NORTHERN STAR. SATURDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1851. DEPOPULATION OF IRELAND.

I had consulted several eminent doctors, who, after doing what they could for me, stated that they considered my case as hopeless.

As may be known, the South-Eastern Railway Company are the proprietors of the present telegraph, and as the company would not sanction the formation of a second line of telegraph, the plan was devised of laying the wires under ground along the road, similar to those which are conveyed under the metropolitan streets to the several telegraph stations.

A REMARKABLE CURE BY TRUE PILLS AND OINTMENT.  —A half-pay lieutenant, lately residing at St. Helier’s, Jersey, whose name by request is omitted, had for three years suffered from piles and fistula, besides a general bearing down, of the most distressing nature. He had twice undergone an operation, but to no purpose, and at last gave himself up: despair.

ALLEGED MURDER BY POISON NEAR NORRINGTON.  —On Wednesday afternoon an adjourned inquest was held on the body of Joseph Barber, of Eastwood, horse dealer, who had died under circumstances which led to the suspicion that he had been poisoned by his wife and a man named Ingram. The facts of the case are briefly these—Some weeks before the 20th of March last the deceased became ill, owing to irregularities of his own, and was attacked with a loathsome disease. His wife, a woman of giant bulk (being six feet two or three inches in height), on the plea of having him ""better nursed,"" introduced into the house a young man named Ingram; with whom she is reported to have, been on intimate terms. During the week preceding the deceased's death Ingram was known to have purchased an ounce of arsenic at Eastwood, and half an ounce at Bulwell, a village about four miles distant from the former; and the day before the deceased's death, his (deceased's) wife's brother obtained another ounce at a grocer's shop in Eastwood.

Obtaining a private interview with the director, the visitor informed him that the lady who had lately become his guest was his wife, who, in a pet arising from a trifling matrimonial quarrel, had left her home, but that, feeling he was in the wrong, he had come to seek a reconciliation. The worthy director could not resist such an appeal, and, showing the penitent up to the lady, left him with cordial wishes for his success. Within an hour the parties came forth with countenances radiant with smiles, and, having paid the account, took leave of the director, with many thanks for his kind attentions. Some days after their departure another carriage drove up, and a gentleman, neither so young nor so attractive as the first, entered, and asked for the same lady, saying that she had misbehaved herself towards her husband, and deserted him; but that, in consideration of her youth and inexperience, he, the new visitor, had succeeded in inducing the husband to forgive and take her back. 'But,' replied the director, 'the quarrel is already at an end. The husband has been here, and they went away together in perfect harmony.' The well-meaning friend was perfectly astounded. On recovering himself, he explained that the lady, who was married to a man much older than herself, was importuned by a younger lover, and had fled to avoid him, but had no doubt yielded at last, and that it was with him she had quitted the asylum she had sought.

Although 327 feet in length, and 52 feet in breadth, the huge mass was tossed about with apparently as much ease as a cork. Those who were below at the time the sea struck the ship, rushed upon deck, and many not accustomed to sea voyages exhibited the greatest consternation, imagining that the ship had split on a rock, or had come in contact with another vessel. So violent was the force of the sea that two of the dead-lights in the bow, with their frames, which were rivetted to the side of the ship, were forced inward, and the water rushed into the forward compartment.

The wreck of the mainmast was floating near, and some of the men had succeeded in reaching this and were sitting upon the rim of the top. The master endeavoured to persuade Colonel Moore to try for this, but the colonel replied, the attempt was useless. The next and last chance was to make for the fore part of the ship, where the fire was not raging with so much intensity. Even this was above Colonel Moore's powers, and the master, in company with one or two others, succeeded in reaching the fore chains, from which he was picked off about 8 o'clock by the boat of the brig Clonmel.  The other deponents corroborate the story. It is evident from their accounts that great confusion ensued, that troops and sailors were under no control, and that the boats were lowered without orders by the crew. Lieutenant Weir says he was pushed into a boat; Joseph Gurder, the chief mate, avers that a jerk of a boat the men were lowering astern pitched him over; that he tried to rejoin the ship but fell back, and that then the tackles were let go; Lieutenant Black, Admiralty agent, went off in a boat without oars. In that boat the second mate went by permission of the captain. He bailed the master to send him some oars, as there were none in the boat; but this the master refused to do, and said, ""But if you send you will leave us."" They were picked up by the chief mate, and towed to the Kennet Kingsford. When the chief mate had reached the Kennet Kingsford he did not return to the burning vessel, because the boats had been put away by some person on board the schooner.

Some hundreds have been hoisted to the top, and, dangerous as the enterprise may appear, all who have braved it acknowledge that the risk was amply repaid by the magnificence of the prospect spread out below them.

Cucumbers, in the open ground, must be attended to; going over them occasionally, and pegging down and regulating all straggling shoots.  Towards the end of the month get in some seed of early cauliflower; sow thickly, and transplant as soon as ready.  The same may be said of lettuces. The best for standing the winter are the brown Dutch and hardy green, though we prefer the black-seeded Bath Coas lettuce, which is a most excellent sort. Cabbage seed should also be sown immediately. Gather herbs for drying, at every convenient opportunity.  In the fruit garden new strawberry beds may be made, towards the middle and latter end of the month. Keen’s Seedling is still a general favourite, and for late cropping nothing is better than the Elton Pine; Myatt’s British Queen is the best of the large sorts, and attains a very great size.",0

It is larger than the common dog, and has a more powerful jaws. Its fur is coarser and thicker, and its ears are smaller and rounder. The tail is short, and curled up over the back. The colour of the fur varies from white to black, but is generally a dark brown. The habits of this animal are very similar to those of the common dog, but it is more aggressive and tenacious in defence of its territory. It is found in the wild states of North America, and is believed to be a native of that continent. I am, Sir, yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS. London, January 14, 1845.",0

After this punishment, on the same day, we are informed, Kelsey sought the wretched offender, and laid him dead at his feet, shooting him in the presence of several gentlemen, who remonstrated with him on the barbarity of the deed. This man Kelsey was afterwards murdered, as was also a brother-in-law, by the Indians of the neighbourhood. Since then repeated acts of violence have been visited on the natives. The Indians were driven to the mountains, and subsequently made predatory incursions upon their old masters, driving away cattle, and indulging their natural propensity to steal. Complaints were made—doubtless the accounts of their conduct highly coloured—to the garrisons at Benicia and Sonoma, and on the first of the month, an expedition was fitted out against them, composed of a detachment of infantry and a company of dragoons, under command of Lieut. Davidson (75 in all) with orders to proceed against the Clear Lake Indians, and exterminate, if possible, the tribe. The troops arrived in the vicinity of the lake, and came unexpectedly upon a body of Indians numbering between 200 and 300. They immediately surrounded them, and as the Indians raised a shout of defiance and attempted escape, poured in a destructive fire indiscriminately upon men, women, and children: ""They fell,"" says our informant, ""as grass before the sweep of the scythe.""

Balfour, of Merton, has prepared a very interesting report on the subject of field-garden operations. The report is divided into two parts, the first of which is devoted to the consideration of the general principles of field-garden culture, and the second to the consideration of the practical operations of the field-garden. The report is very full and complete, and contains much valuable information on the subject. The following are some of the principal points which are discussed in the report:—  1. The importance of field-garden culture as a means of increasing the production of food for the home market, and of supplying the home market with a greater variety of food than can be obtained from the ordinary methods of agriculture.  2. The necessity of field-garden culture for the production of high-class vegetables and fruits, which are in great demand in the home market.  3. The importance of field-garden culture for the production of flowers and ornamental plants, which are in great demand in the home market.  4.

She was warned, but in vain, and henceforth the morning's note, and the afternoon's visit from Chateaubriand were the most important events of her day.  M. Recamier's affairs became again involved, and in 1819 Madame Recamier (after having uselessly sacrificed part of the fortune she inherited from her mother) once more renounced the gaieties of society and established herself in a quiet tranquil retreat, in which she was destined to pass the last years of her life. Her father, his old friend M. Simonard, and M. Recamier resided in the neighborhood, and she herself took a small apartment on the third floor, in the Convent of the Abbaye au Bois. Her existence was henceforth still more independent than it had ever been; and, without failing in any kindness or any duty to the three aged men, her domestic life was now freed from any external bond, and the care of her niece and the daily visits of her friends were the home ties which filled and satisfied her heart. We give the account of her new abode in the words of Chateaubriand himself: ""The bedroom was furnished with a bookcase, a harp, a piano, a portrait of Madame de Staël, and a view of Coppet by moonlight. When, quite out of breath from having climbed three flights of stairs, I entered the cellule at evening, I was enchanted: the windows looked on the garden of the Abbaye, and in the green space nuns were walking and school-girls playing. The top of an acacia-tree reached the level of our eyes; pointed spires stood against the sky, and in the distance were the hills of Sèvres. The setting sun shining in at the open windows lit up the picture. Birds were perched on the raised blinds.""  Here d",0

Ad. de Bacourt. 3 vols. W. Jeffs.  In contemplating the history and biographies of recent or present times and men, we cannot avoid being startled by the discovery that the very abundance of the materials tends to place both history and biography in as doubtful a state of authenticity and accuracy as is the case with those ancient men and eras who are only known through the mists of tradition and fable. Ancient history is unsatisfactory through the meagreness of reliable documents: modern history seems to be in almost as bad a plight through the very opposite evil, the excessive number and the conflicting nature of the materials from which a history or a biography has to be collected. Mirabeau has suffered from this mass of evidence more than almost any other man. It is not going too far to say, that before 1836 the world knew little or nothing concerning him, except the broad facts of his being a dissolute character, and the master spirit of the early years of the Revolution. Perier, Vitty, Chaussad, and one or two more were our sole guides, and they were about as correct in spirit and in fact as to the true occurrences of Mirabeau's life, as Sir Walter Scott is in his novels to those historic celebrities with whom he had no sympathy.

A sunk fence forms the division of orchestra and audience. The performances took place during the summer nights before the Court, and the performers were all amateurs belonging to the Court circle; a more enchanting form of private theatricals one cannot conceive.

After this the mountaineers bore her upon their shoulders. By the time they had reached the Lesghian camp, prior to being conducted to Shamil, they had been almost entirely stripped; their hair was tangled, their skins were torn, their feet bled, and they tottered into the room in which they were to be temporarily confined. Here they were less in the power of the rascals who had brought them up the hills, and were presented with garments of various quaint descriptions. Thus arrayed, they set forth from Shamil's camp with a strong escort of Lesghians, whose demeanour is represented as invariably insolent and brutal. We are scarcely inclined to believe all that the Russian version sets forth as to the beating and bruising of children by these wild legions of Shamil. That prince's _aout_, or permanent camp, was reached at length. First the cavalcade passed through a row of palings, and then, entering through gates in a rampart, were met by Shamil's youthful son at the head of a mounted party. The ladies, in spite of their sufferings, were fascinated by the 'wonderful beauty' of this boy. Next, the Princess Chavchavadze was introduced with many forbodings into the chieftain's seraglio, of which a very minute and interesting account is given, with a plan, sketched by the proud prisoner herself.

The former must be eradicated, but the latter maintained. He must disengage them from their present unworthy situation, and turn them to his new divinity. Superstition herself offers him the means. Acc ording to the universal delusion of the time, each nation stood under the peculiar protection of their national god, and their patriotic pride was flat- tered by assigning him supremacy over the deities of all other countries. To these, divinity was by no means re- fused; it was even recognized; but they must not dare to elevate them- selves above the national god. With this error did Moses connect the truth.

All this part of the work is nobly inspired, and forms a fitting study for the young; although the princess persists in breaking the thread to expatiate on gold-hued and carnine pebbles, on the notes of her guitar in a bower of blossoms, on a vision of the Isler that brings the name of Muller to her memory.

Whatley signals his Logic by taking a great sceptic, and trying his strength upon him. Arnauld did the same thing in his Logic. The analogy is remarkable.  Arnauld, in his first Discourse, observes, in relation to Montaigne, the Hume of France, that after Montaigne had said that the Academics were different from the Pyrrhonists, insomuch as the Academics maintained that some things were more probable than others, which the Pyrrhonists would not allow, Montaigne declares himself on the side of the Pyrrhonists in these terms:—""The opinion of the Pyrrhonists is bolder and much more probable."" To this, Arnauld quickly adds:—""There are, therefore, some things which are more probable than others."" In Dr. Whatley's refutation of Hume, turning upon an illicit process of a major and ambiguous middle term, there is nothing half so brilliant as this.  Were this the place to enter upon the subject, many other remarkable points of similarity between Whatley and Arnauld might be shown.

This is a memorable fact, gentlemen, worthy to be remembered just now when you have yet a choice in fixing upon a course for the present war. Had this policy always been acted upon consistently and reciprocally Russia would never have grown dangerous to the world, nor would Turkey have been in danger now, and Europe together with it. Unfortunately, both Poland and Turkey departed once from that wise policy. Poland at the time when the Turks, supporting one of the national movements of Hungary, advanced so far as to besiege Vienna, in 1888, then it was Sobieski, the gallant King of Poland, who saved the dynasty of Austria in that war. Woe to the memory of that woeful day! On that very day the fate of Poland was sealed, and the basis laid for the desecy of Turkey, and for the growing ascendancy of Russia. Had Sobieski then taken the Hungarians and the Turks for allies, instead of allying himself with Austria, Poland would be existing, living, free, and independent, and Hungary also would be free, and both, in my opinion, would be Christian not less than now, probably more, because—I speak these words now upon calm reflection—the present has always proved more Christian as respects Christian toleration and freedom of conscience than the cross in the hands of certain dynasties—(loud cheers)—who call themselves (Christians, but whose religion is not the gospel, but despotism. (Cheers.) However, Sobieski, resorting to the unnatural alliance with Austria against Hungary and Turkey, then deprived Turkey of the strength necessary to make effective her solicitude for the independence of Poland.

Here is a passage which, though not new, deserves iteration:—  “There is a curious popular desire to attribute great advances in knowledge to accident, and hence we have the discovery of the means for determining specific gravity by Archimedes, of the law of gravitation by Newton, and of chemical electricity by Galvani, constantly attributed to fortuitous circumstances, whereas we have the evidence in these, and in most other similar examples, of a close system of inductive research leading up to the final result. As a general proposition it may be affirmed that there are no accidents in science. In those cases even which assume the character of accidental circumstances, it still requires the observation of a well-trained mind to develop the truth. The same set of circumstances may occur repeatedly before the eyes, and under the hands of ordinary men, without attracting their attention; and even when this is the case, their transient curiosity leads to no inquiry. But that mysterious power, which belongs as an exclusive privilege to genius, seizes the indication, however slight it may be, and advances at once on the path of discovery.”  We must give another passage, that we may protest against its two-fold inaccuracy:—  “The investigations of Galvani, of Humboldt, of Aldini, and more recently the delicate researches of Matteucci, Du Bois-Reymond, and others, prove beyond all doubt, that every motion of the body, and every motion of the mind reacting on the material organism, produces an electrical disturbance, the weak manifestations of which can be measured by the delicate galvanometers we now employ.

Being now at liberty, he left Italy in October, 1842, and entered the English dominions, where he long remained, teaching the sciences and literature. From Corfu, whither he first arrived, he published his celebrated letter to Gregory XIV. From Corfu he proceeded to Malta, and received the appointment of Professor of Divinity in the Protestant Italian College. In 1848 he visited England. In January, 1849, he proceeded to Rome; and on the 24th of June of that year he was married to the youngest daughter of Captain Hely, according to the rites of the reformed Italian church. Five days afterwards he was seized in his own house by French soldiers, acting under the orders of the Inquisition, and carried to St. Angelo. Here he was placed in a cell just vacated by a number of thieves, and in which the only furniture was a filthy mattress, and the only window a hole in the wall. He was refused communication with his friends, and everything not necessary to maintain existence. Great efforts were at this time made by friends in England, and especially by the members of the Evangelical Alliance, to procure his liberation; and the French and Papal governments were waited upon by a deputation which journeyed expressly from this country.

To support a character with uniformity through a variety of incidents, has ever been considered as one of the highest efforts of human genius; and never was a character conceived which it would have been so difficult to support without a living pattern, as that of our Lord. Not only was the perfection of virtue to be exhibited, but this virtue was to be displayed in the person of one who was expressly commissioned and instructed by God, to reform an idolatrous and sinful world. The dignity of a Divine teacher was to be superadded to the man of pure and perfect moral excellence. And how is the task, in fact, executed?

The evils to which the book adverts are extensive and identical in their secret and hidden origin, and there are none to whom, as Parents, Guardians, Heads of Families, and especially of public Schools, is confided the care of young people, who ought to remain for a moment devoid of that information and those salutary cautions this work is intended to convey. Not only are the most delicate forms of generative debility neglected by the family physician, but they require for their safe management the exclusive study of a life entirely abstracted from the routine of general practice, and (as in other departments of the profession) a tentatively concentrated in the daily and long continued observation requisite for the correct treatment of sexual infirmities.

Respected Friend.—Thy excellent Pills have effectually cured me of an asthma, which afflicted me for three years to such an extent that I was obliged to walk my room at night for air, afraid of being suffocated if I went to bed by cough and phlegm. Besides taking the Pills, I rubbed plenty of thy Ointment into my chest night and morning.—(Signed) Benjamin Mackie.—To Professor HOLLOWAY.  CURE OF TYPHUS FEVER WHEN SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE POINT OF DEATH.  A respectable female in the neighbourhood of Loughall was attacked with typhus fever, and lay for five days without having tasted any description of food. She was given over by the surgeon, and preparations were made for her demise. Mr. Benjamin Mackie, the Quaker, whose case is referred to above, heard of the circumstance, and knowing the immense benefit that he himself had derived from Holloway’s Pills, recommended an immediate trial, and eight were given to her, and the same number was continued night and morning for three days, and in a very short time she was completely cured.  N.E.—From advice just received, it appears that Colonel Dear, who is with his regiment in India, the 21st Fusiliers, cured himself of a very bad attack of fever by these celebrated Pills. There is no doubt that any fever, however malignant, may be cured by taking, night and morning, copious doses of this medicine.

All the world has laughed at the mathematician who began to read Thomson's 'Seasons,' but soon shut the book because he could not perceive what was to be proved thereby. But the world should remember that 'it is good to be merry and wise,' and perhaps in this case its own laugh may deserve to be laughed at. The ridicule has not fallen upon the right point. The mathematician is supposed to have been absurd, not for his want of perception of what the poem proved, but for his expecting that it should prove any thing. Now in regarding it as a principle that a poem should prove nothing, the world is as inconsequential as the mathematician was blind in not seeing the consequences and corollaries of Thomson's 'Seasons.' There has never been a true poem that did not prove more, and more to the purpose, than its equal in quantity of Euclid's 'Elements.' All poetry is probative. There is that in it abundantly which might be thrown into the form of propositions, profound and universal ones, and ticketed with an undeniable Q. E. D. In fact, poetry has the privilege of geometry; it demonstrates. It helps us to truths, not by induction, but by intuition. There is no logic so rapid or so satisfactory. Look at that tower, twenty miles off, on the top of Leith Hill, in the light of the setting sun; how distinct its outline, how beautiful its colouring, how picturesque its position, how true its picture on the eye; that sunlight is poetry.

The best practice is to tie each part up loosely with matting (having previously removed the suckers and small leaves,) and then a little earth can be added every week, as the plant increases in height. Another common error arises from earthing Celery too soon. It should be allowed to grow to a considerable size before earthing up is attempted; and be frequently soaked with water, as but little rain will reach the roots afterwards; it should likewise never be touched when the plants are damp. Leeks in drills may have earth drawn up to them by the hoe. Autumn Cauliflowers and Broccoli planted in shallow trenches should now have been filled up; for unless in very dry situations the natural rains will keep them moist. Late Peas and Beans will require close attention, to prevent mildew; well supply the former with liquid manure. The advancing winter crops of Broccoli, Borecole, &c, should be kept frequently hoed, and vacant ground may yet be filled up with the latter kinds.

There can be little doubt that it originated in the east, and at a very remote period of history; and it is certain that it has been known in Hindostan, and adjacent regions, for at least two thousand years. From the Persians it was introduced by the Arabians into Spain; thence it found its way to France; and was made known in England during the reign of William the Conqueror.  The name of the game, and also the names of the pieces with which it is played, have undergone many mutations in travelling from country to country; nevertheless, in the present terms which we employ, the semblance of the original eastern appellations may be seen. In Hindostan it possesses the Sanscrit name of chaturanga, which imports the four members of an army—elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers; the game being a scene of mimic warfare, in which these elements respectively act a peculiar part. The Persians corrupted the Sanscrit word into chatrang, which the Arabians softened into shatranj; from that appellation it passed into stacchi, scacchi, and finally chess.

Geological collections have been shelved and labelled and arranged; how is it that in no museum, no private cabinet in Europe, have we any one pre-Adamite human petrifaction? Most geologists would say, simply because we cannot expect to find what never existed except in imagination. The author can say nothing more than that we may yet find them. But at this rate we should never arrive at any conclusion. The possibilities of the future would weaken or overthrow half the admitted theories of science, if posibilities alone were permitted to invalidate probabilities, and fair and almost inevitable inferences.  When, however, our anonymous theorist deals with the geological part of his subject, he so plainly displays his imperfect acquaintance with that science, that we are pained to think he has not submitted his pages to some competent geologist before publication. Any geological friend would have spared him the discredit and us the pain of pointing out his gross darkness in geological chronology. Here is one proof: ""The Isle of Sheppey, Dr. Mantell assures us, is entirely composed of the London clay—a formation recognised as belonging to the later tertiary, or pre-Adamite age."" That the Isle of Sheppey is composed of London clay is notorious enough, but to say that this formation belongs to the later tertiary age is as notoriously wrong: It belongs to the earlier tertiaries, and is itself the very formation which suggested Lyell's name of Eocene—indicating the dawn of tertiary life.

Having been informed that a certain literary journal had ceased to exist, he observed, ""It is quite in accordance with the laws of necessity that publications which are deficient in vigour, though not failing in good intentions, must perish, while others which, in spite of their bad tendencies, are conducted with a certain amount of ability and skill, flourish, and deserve to do so."" ""Sages,"" he tells us, ""are the only persons who ever do anything, though he himself knows that they sometimes neglect to do many things. For he informs the world that his friend Schlegel left him in the lurch while translating Plato. Is not this the offspring of a light heart and a lively imagination?""

She is independent, she has reason to be satisfied with her children, and is happy in their love.
